For her role in the series, she won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Actress back in 2014. The series ran for seven seasons from June 2010 to June 2017, where it received good reviews and a huge following from beginning to end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, she stepped into the limelight on American Juniors, an American Idol spin-off for children, where she was one of the five winners of the reality show. After this show, in addition to the earlier mentioned Pretty Little Liars, she played the leading role in series such as Bionic Woman, Privileged, and the soon to be released Life Sentence. She has also been involved in a number of films, some of which include Fear Island, Scream 4, and the animation Secret of the Wings, among others.</p><p>Lucy Hale is a very beautiful woman, and her beauty is the subject of this article. Like many women and some men, she has experimented with numerous looks, and in all of them, we can testify of her beauty. Therefore, since it's impossible to be so beautiful without making an effort, this article is about the amazing things we can learn from her beauty routine. In addition to products and input from professionals, her routine shows us the importance of a healthy lifestyle, which we can all adopt. Based on the things she does to maintain her beauty, what do you think you can start doing in order to look and feel even better?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wants-girls-to-embrace-what-makes-them-different><strong>She Wants Girls To Embrace What Makes Them Different</strong></h2><p>One thing you will notice about <a href=#>Lucy Hale</a>'s beauty routine is that she's definitely a pro, and she knows what she's doing. In line with her years of professional experience and exposure to the best makeup artists in the world, her advice, especially to young girls, is they should embrace the very aspects of their bodies which make them different. These girls have to be beautiful in their own eyes first and the whole world will see it also.</p><p>To a great extent, it's very sad seeing young girls trying to change themselves to become like some celebrities out there, yet according to Lucy, what makes them stand out is what makes them cool. When she was growing up, she felt insecure about her big eyebrows and the fact that she had to wear braces. However, knowing what she knows now, she would want girls to embrace their quirks even more because women who are different are the most beautiful and the most confident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-taylor-was-a-beauty-icon-she-looks-up-to><strong>Elizabeth Taylor Was A Beauty Icon She Looks Up To</strong></h2><p>Although Liz Taylor&nbsp;passed away back in 2011 at the age of 79, many people still fondly remember her as a romantic, a silver screen legend, a beauty queen and of course, a fashion icon. Taylor was such an icon despite her legs not being long enough to make her a legendary bombshell, nor did she appear on the cover of the best-dressed lists too often.</p><p>However, Taylor was passionate and full of instinct, and she wore her shortcomings with her greatness. She was alluring, had vicious femininity, knew how to wear her jewelry, and knew how to love. All these qualities contributed to making her one of the most beautiful women of her time, and an inspiration to future generations.</p><p>Lucy Hale immediately points to <a href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a> as one of her beauty icons for the above reasons, especially because she has attractive eyebrows and she loves the classic old school look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=exfoliation-is-important-to-her><strong>Exfoliation Is Important To Her</strong></h2><p>The outer layer of your skin will slough off at least once every week and this translates into the beginning of the accumulation of dead skin. The bottom part of the epidermis will thereafter move up to replace the top layer, a process that takes four weeks, though it will also be completely sloughed out within another two weeks.</p><p>In order to avoid all the terrible consequences of the accumulation of dead skin, some of which involve making your skin rough and darker, and getting pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads, people need to exfoliate.</p><p>Since Lucy has sensitive skin yet it always looks fresh and flawless, she takes exfoliation seriously since she does it three times in a week. She trusts Dr. Lancer's products to take care of her skin; she usually uses Lancer The Method: Polish, as well as Fresh Sugar Face Polish, products which are great for people with normal and dry skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-eye-gels-do-wonders-to-the-skin-under-her-eyes><strong>Her Eye Gels Do Wonders To The Skin Under Her Eyes</strong></h2><p>People say the first thing you notice in someone is their eyes and that they're the windows to the soul, so if you want to have a great first impression, your eyes have to look their best. Lucy has unquestionably beautiful eyes, and this is because she takes great care of them.</p><p>The skin under the eyes can often take a beating when someone is stressed out, resulting in premature wrinkling and puffiness. In order to deal with this situation under your eyes, you will need to use a good eye gel. These gels cool the lower part of the eye and leave you feeling and looking fresh.</p><p>Lucy used to love picking Skyn Iceland Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels from her friend who is a makeup artist, but you can find it at the beauty store easily. This eye gel works in ten minutes to tone, de-puff, and eliminate the wrinkles, all without irritating the skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-loves-her-facials><strong>She Loves Her Facials</strong></h2><p>In 2016 alone, Americans spent $17 billion on spa treatments, with most of that money going to facials. A standard facial involves deep cleaning of the face, extraction of blemishes, a massage, steam treatment, application of a mask or peel, and applying a moisturizer. In addition to making someone feel great, the process improves the skin's appearance in a big way.</p><p>However, when you go for the really expensive treatments, which include microneedling and microdermabrasion treatments, some professionals claim these can work as anti-aging treatments. Since these treatments require professional assistance, they're usually performed in beauty salons and spas, and the nature of an individual's skin will dictate how the treatment will be done.</p><p>Lucy once claimed she had been going to Molly M. Lucio for her facials at Lasky Aesthetics & Laser Center for over five years. She has always wanted to go for facials every week, but she has been consistently going for facials every fortnight. Although she's young, she still looks younger than she actually is, meaning her facials are really working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-values-the-opinion-of-a-dermatologist><strong>She Values The Opinion Of A Dermatologist</strong></h2><p>Almost all of us are guilty of self-medication, where we administer treatments on ourselves without consulting a medical professional, especially in the case of common health issues and dietary supplements. Although this human behavior is common, it's not right, since it's very dangerous.</p><p>When it comes to beauty treatments, people blindly follow other people's beauty regiments, forgetting that we all have different skin types which require different products. Furthermore, the description on the packaging isn't enough for you to qualify every product on the market as fit for your skin.</p><p>Dermatology is a branch of medicine which deals with skin, hair, nails, and their diseases. Therefore, in order to know what is best for her skin and which beauty products and procedures she should use on her skin, Lucy heavily depends on Dr. Zein Obagi to give her direction. She has claimed to spend a lot of money for his services, and we can clearly see just how beautiful her skin, hair, and nails are as a result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-beauty-routine-is-super-low-maintenance><strong>Her Beauty Routine Is Super Low-Maintenance</strong></h2><p>Although Lucy pays attention to every small detail on her face and body, she has a surprisingly low-maintenance beauty routine. When she's not acting, she will only apply concealer, mascara, and the Lucas Paw-Paw balm lip balm made in Australia. On the days she knows she'll be made-up by the makeup artists for a show, she won't waste any time doing it herself.</p><p>A few years back when she was younger and still in school, she was a fan of doing her hair and applying makeup for at least an hour and a half every morning. She never understood why people would claim less was more, because she felt she needed more all the time.</p><p>However, these days she does believe less is more, and she doesn't have that amount of time to spend making up her face. Young girls might also feel as if there's no way they can get out of the house without applying a new face to their existing one, but with time they will also get to this point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-she-smells-like-an-angel><strong>Why She Smells Like An Angel</strong></h2><p>They say that Cleopatra managed to have her way with warlords using the art of scents, and today women are still using this art to make men go crazy about them. Many perfumes contain pheromones, and this means they have the ability to trigger a man's desire, regardless of who he is.</p><p>This just goes to show how powerful a perfume is because the same can also be used to repel anyone, especially if someone applies too much of it or doesn't apply any at all. If you ever get close enough to Lucy, you'll appreciate how choosing the right fragrance can do wonders for how beautiful everyone around you will see you.</p><p>Like everyone who knows what he or she is doing, Lucy wears her spray in the morning before leaving the house. She loves switching the fragrance depending on her mood and the time of the year, generally rotating a few over a six-month period. She was once in love with Mark's Saint Barts Soleil Fragrance, a floral fruity Gourmand fragrance made for women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-watches-what-she-eats><strong>She Watches What She Eats</strong></h2><p>Apart from helping you to lose weight or live healthier, did you know your diet will seriously affect your skin? People who love a lot of meat should know that too much animal fat increases the production of free radicals which are likely to mess up with proper cellular processing. This means such a diet is likely to mess up with your skin.</p><p>On the other hand, a diet full of fresh produce and whole grains is one of the best things someone can do to his or her skin. This is because the antioxidants in such foods cancel out the free radicals which play a huge role in the formation of brown spots, wrinkles, and other signs of aging.</p><p>Although Lucy believes an individual has the right to eat whatever he or she wants, she tries her best to eat good protein and raw foods, though she doesn't follow a particular diet. Since she also has a sweet tooth and she knows life is short, she tries her best to eat everything in moderation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=exercise-plays-a-major-part-in-her-beauty><strong>Exercise Plays A Major Part In Her Beauty</strong></h2><p>It's hard to come across a very beautiful individual who never exercises. Although it might sound as if it's exhausting and time-consuming, exercise will help you achieve your goals for beauty and even surpass them. For instance, it helps improve blood flow, which in turn makes you glow, the circulation stimulates hair follicles and its growth, and sweating helps your skin to detox, among other advantages.</p><p>Lucy is into SoulCycle, and she enjoys spinning, despite being against it before. This exercise, even though it's in a room with other people, works for her both physically and mentally. In addition, she's into CorePower Yoga, which she once claimed was really good for her because it helps her slow down and forces her to relax.</p><p>Finally, she works with a personal trainer a few days in a week. The advantage of having such a trainer is having someone to monitor your progress, keep you in check, and help you to improve with every other day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-applies-sunscreen-every-day><strong>She Applies Sunscreen Every Day</strong></h2><p>Regardless of how tough you think you are, you need to protect your skin from the sun, especially if you want it to look beautiful. As refreshing as the sun might be, especially if you're from a cold region and you get the chance to spend an afternoon at the beach.</p><p>You need to know that the ozone layer isn't as good as it was a few decades ago, and the harmful rays from the sun can cause so much damage, including skin cancer. Applying sunscreen will prevent discoloration and the development of brown spots on your skin, as well as reducing the risk of developing skin cancer, sunburns, and premature aging.</p><p>Lucy loves her skin, therefore she wears sunscreen every day, because she understands just how important it is to her skin. She loves using SPF sunscreen products such as the SkinCeuticals Sheer Physical UV Defense SPF 50, which she mixes with her moisturizer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-she-chooses-her-lipstick><strong>How She Chooses Her Lipstick</strong></h2><p>Although most people think that lipstick is purely a fashion accessory with the main purpose of helping a woman achieve her desired appearance in relation to her style and clothing, it has many more benefits. In addition to beauty, lipstick is essential in preserving the natural state of the lips with some brands helping to moisturize them. Also, depending on the brand, lipstick can be a great sunscreen, meaning it can reduce the harmful effects of the sun on someone's lips.</p><p>Lucy always wears lipstick and she always looks beautiful with it. She used to love wearing reds a while back but then moved to plums and burgundies, especially when attending dinners and events. She prefers using Mark lipsticks, and at times you can catch her wearing Vixen. As she continues to grow, she changes the color of her lipstick, probably because she wants to look different and do things other people don’t.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=makeup-removers><strong>Makeup Removers</strong></h2><p>As the name suggests, makeup removers are products created specifically to help you remove makeup from your face before you clean it. The reason it's so important to use these products before cleansing is they protect your skin from breakouts, developing pimples, and clogging your pores, and they make it easier to clean the face properly. As is the case with most beauty products, you need to choose the types that are good for your skin type.</p><p>Lucy loves using Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, and she claims they can remove any makeup without irritating her skin. After a day of looking stunning, Lucy claims there's no better feeling like wiping her makeup off and feeling clean when going to bed between clean sheets. Furthermore, since she has sensitive skin, she trusts Dr. Lancer's products, and she loves using The Method Cleanse Cleanser and Mario Badescu Drying Lotion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-she-deals-with-acne><strong>How She Deals With Acne</strong></h2><p>When oil and dead skin plug the skin's hair follicles, the skin develops acne. Although this condition is very common among teenagers, it can affect anyone regardless of age. Someone with acne will develop pimples, blackheads, or even whiteheads, on the face, chest, shoulders, and upper back.</p><p>The problem with acne is its persistence since with proper treatment the bumps and pimples will appear to heal, others often take their place. If you want to deal with this condition effectively, you would need to start treatment as soon as possible.</p><p>Since Lucy has been through a lot because of acne, she knows the best course of treatment for her skin, because especially for acne, what works for someone else might not work for you. Lucy employs the double cleansing method, where she uses DHC Deep Cleansing Oil to lather her face while removing makeup and then using the Restorsea Reviving Cleanser to make sure no makeup survives her wash. Furthermore, she uses a prescription retinol cream at night, which is also an anti-aging product.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-amazing-hair><strong>Her Amazing Hair</strong></h2><p>Unlike men, who can get the same haircut for decades, many women love to change their look especially by playing around with different hairstyles. Lucy used to have perfectly tangled waves then she got short-textured bobs, and now her hair is growing back. In all those looks, she seems to grow ever more beautiful. We also expect her to change many more times, depending on the characters she will play on TV or in films.</p><p>However, since it's clear she loves her wavy and thick natural hair, when she's going natural, oil builds up quite easily and she needs a clarifying shampoo to deal with it. She loves using Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo. On the other hand, she considers Blow Pro Faux Dry, a dry shampoo the best in the market especially for brown-haired women since she washes her hair three times a week and it doesn’t make her hair chalky.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ptaq6xqxkraddoLuww4yamaitpGK5tq%2FYZp%2BapJWoeqOxwK6rsmWgp7ylwcKtqmaqn6rBqrrEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-things-to-know-about-lucy-hales-beauty-products-routine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-things-to-know-about-lucy-hales-beauty-products-routine.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-things-to-know-about-lucy-hales-beauty-products-routine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-things-to-know-about-lucy-hales-beauty-products-routine.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-things-to-know-about-lucy-hales-beauty-products-routine.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-things-to-know-about-lucy-hales-beauty-products-routine.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bigfoot-expert-weighs-in-on-colorado-footage-notices-one-surprising-detail.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bigfoot-expert-weighs-in-on-colorado-footage-notices-one-surprising-detail.html>Bigfoot expert weighs in on Colorado footage, notices one surprising detail</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhonda-fleming-net-worth.html>Rhonda Fleming Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rhonda-fleming-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
