We want to take off. We don’t need food. We just want to go,'” Thorngren claimed of the first class passengers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Four planes crashed that day — two into the towers, one into the Pentagon, and the last in a field in Pennsylvania. <span class=credit>Suzanne Plunkett/AP</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mannello recalls his flight being grounded and JFK airport shuttered following the attack. <span class=credit>Tamara Beckwith/New York Post</span></figure><p>Mannello said he steered the plane toward the runway, unaware of what was unfolding in Manhattan at the time.</p><p>He didn’t get cleared to take off though, as air traffic control ordered all flights back to their gates for a mass evacuation.</p><p>The attack killed 2,996 people, including <a href=#>19 hijackers </a>aboard four flights.</p><p>American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to LA struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m., and United Airlines Flight 175, also from Boston to LA, crashed into the South Tower less than 20 minutes later.</p><p>American Airlines Flight 77, from Washington DC, struck the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., while United Flight 93, from Newark to San Francisco, crashed in a Pennsylvania field, likely en route to the Capitol or White House.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Some 2,996 people were killed in the coordinated attack, including the 19 hijackers. <span class=credit>Matthew McDermott for NY Post</span></figure><p>Flight 23’s crew believes they could have suffered a similar fate.</p><p>“I definitely think that Flight 23 from JFK to LAX was the fifth plane,” Thorngren says in the doc. “And that’s what scares, haunts me to this day.”</p><p>TMZ reports that 20 minutes after passengers and crew members disembarked the United flight, and the aircraft was locked, people on the ground saw two uniformed individuals running in the passenger cabin.</p><p>According to the doc, when authorities came to investigate, they discovered an opened floor hatch, which led from the cabin to the belly of the plane.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">TMZ reported two uniformed people were spotted running about the locked plane’s cabin that day.
