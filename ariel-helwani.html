His other maternal uncle, Gad Saad, is a Lebanese-Canadian evolutionary psychologist.</p><p>He works at John Molson School of Business, which applies evolutionary psychology to marketing and consumer behavior.</p><p>Growing up in a culturally diverse environment, Helwani can speak several languages. He is fluent in English, French, and Hebrew. Similarly, he understands Spanish and Arabic.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Helwani grew up in Mount Royal, Quebec, and Westmount, a Montreal suburb. He first went to Akiva School, then studied at Herzliah High School.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Helwani.webp><p>He then joined Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in Syracuse, New York, and graduated from the university in 2004.</p><h2><span>Age, & Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Having been born on&nbsp;July 15, 1978, Ariel is 46 years old as of 2023. Also, his star sign happens to be Cancer.</p><p>And from what we know, the people of this sign are known for being brave, determined, passionate, and energetic.</p><p>Regarding his physique, Helwani stands at 1.81 m and weighs around 242 lbs.</p><p>Likewise, Ariel’s other notable body facts are his short dark brown hair and shining pair of light brown eyes.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>Professional Career</span></h2><p>Helwani started working with MMA Fighting and has been in the <a href=# rel=noopener>MMA</a> reporting business since 2006.</p><p>He hosted The MMA Hour podcast and an MMA Beat show on YouTube. He was a co-host of the Sirius XM radio show “Fight Club.”&nbsp;</p><p>He has also worked as “MMA Insider” for Fox Sports 1’s weekly UFC Tonight and other pre- and post-event programming since 2011.</p><p>Helwani is also the interim vice president of the Mixed Martial Arts Journalists Association. The organization is deemed to be very controversial.</p><p>Additionally. he works as a host in a show called “Ariel & the Bad Guy” at ESPN. He partnered with <a href=# rel=noopener>Chael Sonnen</a> as a co-host for the show.</p><p>Similarly, he has been continuing his podcast and reports on MMA for all ESPN platforms.</p><h2>UFC&nbsp;</h2><p>The UFC escorted Helwani and his two colleagues out of UFC 199 before the main event on June 4, 2016.</p><p>Moreover, the press credentials of the three of them were taken. The trio was banned for life from all UFC events.</p><p>Helwani reported the revival of <a href=# rel=noopener>Brock Lesnar</a> at UFC 200 hours before UFC announced it on the broadcast, which he did without notifying UFC first.</p><p>UFC spokesman Dave Sholler came forward, saying such reporting was against standard practice. Later, UFC Joe Rogan said that the company had asked Helwani not to report that news.</p><p>The management assumed that a mole had broken that news to him without knowing the responsible person. Hence, they went to remove all possible suspects from the company.</p><p>However, Helwani had a different story to tell. He refused to accept Rogan’s story and considered it 100% inaccurate.</p><h3>Got More Severe</h3><p>Dana White, the current president of UFC, did not like the news and said the ban would not be dismissed as long as he serves at UFC.</p><p>White further added that he wouldn’t have issues with Helwani covering the event without credentials.</p><p>Helwani then came forward with his side of the story. He explained the incident in an emotional broadcast on the June 6 episode of The <a href=# rel=noopener>MMA</a> Hour.</p><p>He said he was invited to see Dana White, who told him he was banned for being too negative. Helwani later discovered that Lorenzo Fertitta made the entire call.</p><p>Moreover, he announced that he would continue to work as an MMA journalist. Life is all about ups and downs.</p><p>There are times when you fall into the trap, and there are also times when you create the trap.</p><p>As long as you are determined to continue the profession you love with pride, nothing should bother you. Helwani stood by this theory indeed.</p><h3>And Then</h3><p>Helwani did not end up having an entirely negative image. Many high-profile UFC fighters sympathized with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones posted on Twitter that news of Helwani’s ban is unfortunate, sympathizing and empathizing with him.</p><p>Helwani’s close friend <a href=# rel=noopener>Daniel Cormier</a> also showed similar feelings.</p><p>Former Middleweight champion Chris Weidman wrote on Twitter, “This sport needs the GOAT of MMA reporting.”</p><p>The UFC canceled the move on June 6. They stated they would not prevent MMAFighting.com from receiving media credentials to cover live UFC events.</p><p>The UFC further added that they respect the role played by media in the sport and beyond. They also acknowledged the importance of reporting MMA Fighting’s ability.</p><p>But they also talked about the incident, calling it the recurring tactics used by the lead reporter extended beyond journalism’s purpose.</p><p>They concluded by saying they feel confident about their adequately communicated position to the SB Nation editorial team.</p><h3><span>Mayweather Vs. McGregor Ban</span></h3><p>Helwani has indeed been a very controversial figure.</p><p>He came forward, saying that UFC removed him from the Showtime broadcast team hours before the first press conference. It was during the <a href=#>Mayweather</a> vs. <a href=#>McGregor</a> press tour.</p><p>He went to Twitter and wrote that he wouldn’t be working for SHOsports anymore on the May/Mac tour.</p><p>He further said that UFC specifically asked to remove him and expressed his disappointment.</p><h3>ESPN</h3><p>His contract with MMA Fighting was about to expire in June 2018; he received offers from ESPN in February; hence, he joined ESPN in May 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>ESPN is the UFC’s official broadcast partner. Helwani hosts Ariel Helwani’s MMA Show on Twitter and YouTube.</p><p>Similarly, he hosts “Ariel and the Bad Guy” on ESPN +. He also hosts a Wednesday podcast.</p><p>He is a part of occasional ESPN broadcasts of the NBA. UFC and ESPN shared a working relationship for quite a while.</p><p>Hence, the objectivity of Helwani and other ESPN personalities like Brett Okamoto always stays in a risky place.</p><p>You can read Helwani’s articles at Muck Rack and Sport Bible. Similarly, you can listen to his radio podcast on the website of Radio Net.</p><h3>Comeback At MMA Fighting&nbsp;</h3><p>Andrew Marchand from the New York Post reported that he made just short of $500k annually at ESPN. However, their new offers to him included a 5% pay reduction as part of company-wide cost-cutting.</p><p>The reporter announced his departure from ESPN after failing to reach terms on a new contract in June 2021.</p><p>Helwani returned to MMA Fighting and works as a host and producer of the MMA Hour twice a week. He also works for BT Sport and Spotify/The Ringer, covering boxing and professional wrestling while creating non-MMA content for his YouTube channel.</p><p>Substack is the account where he shares his written thoughts. He expressed he does not want to be known as “the MMA guy” or “the combat guy. I want to be viewed, quite honestly if I can be so brash, as the best interviewer in sports. And if I want to do that, Inned to do many different things.”</p><p>He has been a brand ambassador of BetMGM since September 2021. In July 2022, he returned to Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel as an on-air correspondent.</p><p>Helwani shared his thought on <a href=#>Stephanie McMahon</a>‘s WWE exit on 10 January 2023.</p><p>He described her as a very beloved leader; she lit up everybody’s spirits, and nobody had a bad thing to say about her. In her leadership, everybody was just very happy, according to him.</p><p>In the Bill Simons Podcast, Helwani and Simon said that her leave was a “bad sign” for the company.</p><p>Helwani complemented, “She’s so likable and respected,” and “She is the quintessential businesswoman.”</p><p>They believe that she can achieve anything if she wants to.</p><p>Ariel is hopeful that Khan and Paul Levesque, still working in the company’s executive office, will do a good job.</p><p>White made major announcements at the post-fight press conference that Francis Ngannou’s departure on 5 February. Francis’s lengthy contractual dispute started before his successful title defense against Ciryl Gane in January.</p><p>He revealed that “The Predator” rejected a contract offer that would have made him the highest-paid heavyweight of all time.</p><h3>Feud With Ali Abdelaziz</h3><p>Helwani has a long-term feud with mixed martial arts manager Ali Abdelaziz, president of Dominance MMA Management.</p><p>Josh Gross of The Athletic reported on June 2020 that Abdelaziz is angry about disseminating negative rumors by Helwani.</p><p>On the contrary, Helwani denied the allegation while confirming that he had not had access to interview Abdelaziz’s fighters for more than a year.</p><p>In one of the episodes of UFC 251, where DC & Helwani disagreed with the suggestion that&nbsp; Gilbert Burns should be next to receive a title match against then-champion Kamaru Usman.</p><p>Helwani suggested a match between Burns and Leon Edwards would determine a number one contender.</p><p>Helwani claimed that Abdelaziz called Helwani’s boss while employed at ESPN and attempted to have him fired.</p><p>Most of Abdelaziz’s clients still declined to be interviewed by Helwani, with some expectations as of August 2022.</p><h2>Honors & Awards</h2><p>Helwani might be anything but not an incapable journalist.
