But even though this is Green's most publicized 90210 love story, he actually dated two other co-stars while playing the sometimes messy character of David Silver.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian Austin Green has been in a relationship with Sharna Burgess for a while now and they have a son, Zane, who was born in June 2022. But fans can't help but want to know more about his Beverly Hills 90210 dating history. Who did Brian Austin Green date besides Tiffani Thiessen? And what were these relationships like?</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-beverly-hills-90210-co-stars-brian-austin-green-and-tori-spelling>What Happened Between Beverly Hills 90210 Co-Stars Brian Austin Green And Tori Spelling?</h2><p><a href=#>Tori Spelling talked about Shannen Doherty getting fired</a> and a lot of behind-the-scenes facts have come out since the reboot BH90210 aired in the summer of 2019. Since co-stars often date when they star on a popular TV show, it was hard for Beverly Hills 90210 fans not to wonder if Tori Spelling and Brian Austin Green ever had a relationship.</p><p>After all, the actors played the long-term couple Donna Martin and David Silver. They often had problems and David could be unfair and mean at times. But they were still an adorable pair and it was hard not to be curious if their feelings had moved offscreen as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They hit a long list of milestones, from graduating from high school together to getting married in the series finale. Even though fans love watching Kelly Taylor and Dylan McKay's on-again and off-again relationship, it's tough not to swoon over David and Donna.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tori-spelling-1.jpg><p>In 2019, Brian Austin Green said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and Tori Spelling were involved</a> when they filmed Beverly Hills 90210. Based on what the actor said, it sounds like it was a casual thing rather than a serious relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tori Spelling Still Feels Guilty Over Shannen Doherty's Controversial Firing On 90210</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Green appeared on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen and a fan phoned in, asking, "Did you and Tori Spelling ever have a romantic relationship while filming 90210? She said that you two hooked up.” This was definitely a question that many people have asked since Beverly Hills 90210 premiered in 1990. Now, several years later, fans have some answers. And the situation sounds very dramatic.</p><p>Green replied, “We hooked up, yeah. We did. But we were young, and it was — so, that’s what young people do.”</p><p>However, while Green made this sound like a brief interaction, Spelling told another story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brian-austin-green-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, the actress was interviewed by Tammin Sursok and Roxy Manning on their podcast, Women On Top. She said, "Brian Austin Green, I mean David and Donna, we were on camera together and we are off camera, something.[Brian] and I have different perspectives of what that was. There's the young girl version and the young boy version, so two different versions."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tori Spelling Was Accused Of Overreacting Amid Health Issues That Landed Her In The Hospital</a></span></p><p>This was definitely surprising for Beverly Hills 90210 fans to hear. According to Entertainment Tonight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spelling shared more about the relationship</a>. She said that Green told her that he loved her, but when she mentioned that to him, he said that wasn't the case at all.</p><p>Spelling said on the Women On Top podcast, "It's so funny, because to me, I was like, 'Remember that summer we were together? You said 'I love you' and I said 'I love you.' And he remembers none of that. He was like, 'No, we hooked up. We were friends.'" Spelling said it was "cool" that this is his POV. Still, this must have been a tough situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tori-spelling.jpg><p>Tori Spelling continued that when she and Brian Austin Green were filming Donna and David's wedding episode, it was a very emotional moment. She remembers talking to her co-star Jennie Garth, who played Donna's friend Kelly Taylor, and saying that she might be in love with Green again. Then Spelling realized that she wanted to move on from the experience.</p><p>The Beverly Hills 90210 actors don't seem to have specified the exact time when they were together. But Tori Spelling has had several other, more high-profile romances. Before marrying Dean McDermott, she was married to Charlie Shanian​​​​​​​ and also dated Julian Lennon and Patrick Muldoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-brian-austin-green-and-vanessa-marcil>What Happened Between Brian Austin Green And Vanessa Marcil?</h2><p>Brian Austin Green and Vanessa Marcil have a son together named Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green who is now 20 years old. But while the spotlight has been on their recent drama, fans might not know that the couple began dating as they bonded while filming Beverly Hills 90210, according to E! News.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vanessa-marcil.jpg><p>Marcil played mean girl Gina Kincaid in seasons 9 and 10 of the teen drama, and her episodes aired from 1998 to 2000.

He decided to have it removed, which was two decades after he first got it.</p><p>Since the former couple is often in the news because they've been fighting about whether Green has been a good dad to Kassius, it's easy to forget that Marcil and Green dated over 20 years ago. They broke up in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Little is known about what Brian Austin Green and Vanessa Marcil's romance was like on the set of Beverly Hills 90210.
