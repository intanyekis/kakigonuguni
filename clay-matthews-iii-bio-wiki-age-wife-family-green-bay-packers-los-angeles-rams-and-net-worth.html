Physically, he was a late bloomer. His father was the team’s defensive coordinator but declined to start his son because he was physically diminutive.</p><p>Matthews started developing physically in his senior season, but only garnered interest from Division I FCS schools and local community colleges. He has described his own recruiting status out of high school as “not applicable.”</p><p>Like his father and uncle, Matthews opted to attend the University of Southern California with hopes of becoming a walk-on for the Trojans football team.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=clay-matthews-iii-college></span>Clay Matthews III College<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Matthews attended the University of Southern California and played for the Trojans from 2004 to 2008 under head coach Pete Carroll. Though he was the son of an All-Pro NFL linebacker, he entered USC as an unheralded, walk-on student-athlete.</p><p>During his first season, USC’s 2004 BCS National Championship, he played only on the scout team and turned down several playing opportunities during garbage time during the fourth quarters of games to preserve his redshirt status and remaining seasons of NCAA eligibility. He remained a nonathletic scholarship (a “walk-on”) reserve linebacker during the 2005 season and played mainly on special teams.</p><p>He was granted full athletic scholarship status at the beginning of the 2006 season. Matthews continued to play reserve linebacker in the 2006 and 2007 seasons and made two starts in 2007 in place of injured teammate Brian Cushing.</p><p>He was awarded USC’s Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007 and blocked two field goals in the later season. During the off-season, Matthews committed to weight training and conditioning programs to gain size and improve his performance level and stamina.</p><p>At the beginning of the 2008 season, defensive coordinator Nick Holt, Carroll, and Norton decided to try using Matthews in a hybrid “elephant” position, where Matthews would stand in the position of defensive end, but use the speed and tactics of a linebacker; the coaches had used Cushing in the position in a similar manner in 2006.</p><p>The experiment was successful, as Matthews recorded 4.5 sacks while playing together with his other NFL-bound teammates Brian Cushing, Rey Maualuga, and Kaluka Maiava.</p><p>Likewise, Matthews continued his spectacular special-teams play and was awarded USC’s Co-Special Teams Player of the Year in 2008, making him the only player in USC history to be awarded three consecutive Special Teams Player of the Year awards. He was a participant in the 2009 Senior Bowl and was considered a top prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft.</p><p>Matthews was one of 12 senior USC football players, including the four linebackers Cushing, Maiava, Matthews, and Maualuga, invited to the 2009 NFL Scouting Combine. Matthews, Maualuga, and Cushing were featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s 2009 NFL Draft Preview magazine, as all three were regarded by it as potential first-round selections.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=clay-matthews-iii-professional></span><span>Clay Matthews III Professional</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=green-bay-packers></span>Green Bay Packers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On August 7, 2008, the Green Bay Packers traded Brett Favre to the New York Jets for what would become the Jets’ third-round draft pick (83rd overall) in the 2009 NFL Draft.</p><p>On draft day, April 25, 2009, the Packers traded their second-round pick (41st overall, Darius Butler), their third-round pick (73rd overall, Derek Cox, Jacksonville Jaguars), and the 83rd overall pick acquired for Favre (Brandon Tate) to the New England Patriots for a first-round pick (26th overall) and a fifth-round pick (162nd overall, Jamon Meredith) in that year’s draft.</p><p>The Packers used the first-round pick obtained from the Patriots to acquire Matthews with the 26th overall selection in the 2009 NFL Draft. Kevin Greene, the former All-Pro linebacker who is third on the all-time sack list with 160 (most ever by a linebacker), was hired by Dom Capers in 2009 to coach the outside linebacker position. He saw a lot of himself in Matthews but feared the Packers would not be able to draft him.</p><p>Analysts were shocked when the Packers traded up for Matthews, whom they did not regard as a first-round draft prospect due to his limited playing experience at USC (only starting the final ten games of his senior season.) Greene later stated that Matthews has a “set of skills that I have not seen in an outside linebacker. Clay has a set of skills that I didn’t have. He has another gear I didn’t have. He’s better than Kevin Greene was.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=los-angeles-rams></span>Los Angeles Rams<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On March 19, 2019, Matthews signed a two-year contract with the Los Angeles Rams. He made his debut with the Rams in Week 1 against the Carolina Panthers, making three tackles and sacking Cam Newton once as the Rams won 30–27.</p><p>In Week 2 against the New Orleans Saints, Matthews recorded another sack against Teddy Bridgewater as the Rams won 27–9. In Week 3 against the Cleveland Browns, Matthews sacked Baker Mayfield twice in the 20–13 win.</p><p>In Week 5, after the Rams’ 30–29 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, it was announced that Matthews suffered a broken jaw and would undergo surgery. He ended up missing three games, finishing the season with 13 starts. In the off-season, on March 19, 2020, Matthews was released by the Rams. He did not play during the 2020 season.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-clay-matthews-iii></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Clay Matthews III</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-clay-matthews-iii></span>Who is Clay Matthews III?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Matthews is a former American football outside linebacker who was born and brought up in Northridge, California.
