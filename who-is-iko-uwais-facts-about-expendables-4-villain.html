At an age where an extravagant amount of CGI and overly-touched pictures are blatantly used in films, Uwais' presence is like an antidote for those who long for real action sequences. Hailing from a humble beginning in Jakarta, Indonesia, Iko Uwais has starred in some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the biggest action films in his home country</a>, as he's now slowly shifting into the Western market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How The Rock Made $87.5 Million During A Pandemic</a></span></p><p>Recently, the actor has been tipped as the next villain in the upcoming Expendables 4, starring opposites of Jason Statham, Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, and Randy Couture. So, who is Iko Uwais, and why does he look ... familiar? To sum it up, here are some interesting facts about the martial arts star, and what the future holds in store for him.</p><h2 id=iko-uwais-job-before-fame><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Iko Uwais Job Before Fame</span></h2><p>Born in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, Iko Uwais found his love for martial arts from an early age. His grandfather was a master who founded a silat martial arts school back home. At the age of 10, Iko studied the art of silat Betawi in his uncle's school, Tiga Berantai.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He further took his skill to test by competing in numerous competitions. This included the National Silat Championship in 2005, where he was hailed as the best player of the tournament. However, during his time preparing for competition after competition, young Iko worked as a truck driver for a telecommunication company.</p><h2 id=how-iko-uwais-was-discovered><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Iko Uwais Was Discovered</span></h2><p>It wasn't until 2007 when director Gareth Evans discovered Iko Uwais' talent. At the time, the Welsh director was filming a documentary about silat in Iko's hometown when he felt Iko's charisma and natural on-camera presence. The actor then signed a five-year contract with Gareth's company and quit his truck driving job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor-director pair put their chemistry to test the 2009 action film Merantau, where Iko starred as the lead hero. They linked up again in 2011 for The Raid, a gritty Indonesian version of Assault on Precinct 13, which catapulted Iko's name as the next martial art star. Its sequel, The Raid 2, was released in 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is 'The Expendables 4' Still Happening?

He and his talented Raid cast mates, Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman, were cast in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but the cameo was a disappointingly waste of talent. People were expecting few epic battle sequences, as the Indonesians would be playing members of an intergalactic criminal gang, but that wasn't the case. Iko's talent was heavily underused, and his screen time was too limited.</p><h2 id=iko-uwais-in-39-wu-assassins-39-amp-its-upcoming-standalone-film><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Iko Uwais In 'Wu Assassins' & Its Upcoming Standalone Film</span></h2><p>Iko Uwais secured the lead role of <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>'s martial arts hit Wu Assassins back in 2019. As San Francisco Chinatown chef-turned-assassin Kai Jin, the actor unleashed his martial art skill to its full potential throughout its ten episodes. The actor initially signed up to for project as a fight choreographer, but showrunner John Wirth extended Iko's scope of responsibilities after learning about his acting career in Indonesia. A standalone sequel film, Fistful of Vengeance, is coming to Netflix this year, picking up the ending of the season finale left off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Sylvester Stallone Went From Living In A Bus Terminal To Being Worth $400 Million</a></span></p><p>"I had been a huge fan of The Raid movies. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But nobody was even remotely considering getting Iko. </a>We set out to find somebody ‘like Iko.’ Everybody said ‘let’s just get a guy like Iko.’ Of course, the first thing that comes to mind after that is who is that? (laughs). Who is like Iko? Nobody," the director recalled in an interview.</p><h2 id=iko-uwais-has-two-kids><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Iko Uwais Has Two Kids</span></h2><p>Iko Uwais is a proud father of two daughters, Atreya (born 2013) and Aneska (born 2018), from his relationship with Indonesian singer Audy Item. The pair tied the knot at a hotel in Jakarta in June 2012. The pair often has to spend time away from each other, while Iko travels to the United States to film movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sometimes I'm upset with myself, but what can you do?," said the actor in an interview with Indonesian outlet Suara. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You have to be professional. </a>That's an answer that can't be changed anymore because this is what I work for."</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-iko-uwais><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For Iko Uwais?</span></h2><p>So, what's next for the next big thing in Hollywood's martial arts? Iko Uwais is a rare talent, as there aren't that many actors who do their own stunts, let alone choreograph them by themselves. The major villain role in The Expendables 4 could be the big break that Iko needs to propel his name to the American audience.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's What Jason Statham Did Before He Was An Actor</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButcqoZK6vkZ7AbrLAnKusZZGXvLbAjJ6vqZ2ema6juMSsZG1lpp65ra3Ip2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-iko-uwais-facts-about-expendables-4-villain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-iko-uwais-facts-about-expendables-4-villain.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-iko-uwais-facts-about-expendables-4-villain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-iko-uwais-facts-about-expendables-4-villain.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-iko-uwais-facts-about-expendables-4-villain.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-iko-uwais-facts-about-expendables-4-villain.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cariba-heine.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cariba-heine.html>Cariba Heine</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./super-bowl-2023-cara-delevingne-wears-rihanna-concert-t-shirt.html>Super Bowl 2023: Cara Delevingne Wears Rihanna Concert T-Shirt</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./super-bowl-2023-cara-delevingne-wears-rihanna-concert-t-shirt.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
