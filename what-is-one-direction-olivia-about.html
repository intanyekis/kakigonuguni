Especially after the release of Olivia's movie, Don't Worry Darling, starring Harry Styles and Florence Pugh, the couple have been making headlines periodically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the many things fans have focused on lately is the One Direction song 'Olivia'. The reason why people made the connection between the track and the director is obvious, but the truth is that there is no real reason to believe the song has anything to do with Olivia Wilde.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-and-olivia-wilde-39-s-somewhat-controversial-relationship>Harry Styles And Olivia Wilde's Somewhat Controversial Relationship</h2><p>It was a bit of a shock for fans when the news of Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde's relationship came out, and even though they have been together for a while now, their romance still causes controversy sometimes.</p><p>The drama surrounding Olivia's new movie, Don't Worry Darling, and <a href=#>the director's very public custody battle</a> didn't help, but even so, people tend to be overly harsh when judging their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the couple has chosen to remain private for the most part, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">both Olivia and Harry have expressed how annoyed they are</a>. Particularly the singer said he doesn't like how people treat Olivia.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Olivia Wilde Is Fed Up With The Rumors: She Didn't Leave Jason Sudeikis For Harry Styles</a></span></p><p>"That obviously doesn’t make me feel good," Harry said recently. "It’s obviously a difficult feeling to feel like being close to me means you’re at the ransom of a corner of Twitter or something. I just wanted to sing. I didn’t want to get into it if I was going to hurt people like that."</p><p>He also said he doesn't understand "that kind of toxic negativity" some fans direct towards his relationship, but he also said he doesn't think that represents his fandom. "The majority of them are true champions of kindness," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her part, Olivia is trying her best not to let the bad comments affect her, but admittedly, it's not always easy.</p><p>"It’s obviously really tempting to correct a false narrative," she explained. "But I think what you realise is that when you’re really happy it doesn’t matter what strangers think about you. All that matters to you is what’s real, and what you love, and who you love."</p><h2 id=why-fans-went-crazy-about-harry-styles-singing-39-olivia-39>Why Fans Went Crazy About Harry Styles Singing 'Olivia'</h2><p>Had Harry Styles released a song titled 'Olivia' in the past couple of years, the connection between the name of the song and his girlfriend would have been a no-brainer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As things stand, however, him performing the One Direction song 'Olivia' caused a commotion in the fandom. The song is part of One Direction's last album, Made in the A.M., which came out in 2015, right before the band went on a hiatus that continues to this day.</p><p>The album featured only four members, because by that time Zayn Malik had left the group, and they parted ways before they even got to tour. This means the song 'Olivia' was never performed live by One Direction. So, it was a big surprise when Harry Styles performed it live in Las Vegas in 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Harry Styles Has Said To Critics Of His Relationship With Olivia Wilde</a></span></p><p>As always, fans came up with theories about why he chose to suddenly play that particular song. Those included the speculation that he already loved Olivia Wilde back then, though there is nothing that indicates that they had any sort of relationship before they started working together on Don't Worry Darling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, a lot of people can't help connecting the director with the song since then.</p><h2 id=the-true-meaning-behind-the-song>The True Meaning Behind The Song</h2><p>Regardless of whether or not Harry Styles had an ulterior motive to play that song on that particular night, he never could have expected people to react so strongly. And he definitely couldn't have predicted he'd be asked about the meaning of a song he wrote with his old band over five years ago.</p><p>But fortunately for him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had already answered that question years ago</a>, when the song first came out. So, in case readers were wondering what 'Olivia' is really about, this is what the singer shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Olivia Wilde Says Pay Disparity Between Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Is 'Nonexistent'</a></span></p><p>"You can put names in things, and it seems like there’s no grey area, but it doesn’t have to be so literal," Harry explained.</p><p>"'Olivia' could be a place or a family member, it’s not necessarily about me. It might be an observation. Obviously when you listen to it, you assume that there’s a girl called Olivia. Which could be true, but isn’t necessarily the case. It’s cool to kind of explore — I always think it’s fun to take a situation or an emotion then personify it."</p><p><a href=#>Harry Styles did, however, dedicate lots of his new songs to Olivia Wilde</a>. The couple seems to be very happy together, despite all the negativity from the public, so there's no telling where they'll go together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ec6nnGacmaeypMDIqKVmp5yew6qtjJqZqK2kZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-one-direction-olivia-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-one-direction-olivia-about.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-one-direction-olivia-about.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-one-direction-olivia-about.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-one-direction-olivia-about.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-one-direction-olivia-about.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shekinah-90-day-fiance-ethnicity-amish-background-and-religion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shekinah-90-day-fiance-ethnicity-amish-background-and-religion.html>Shekinah 90 Day Fiance Ethnicity | Amish Background And Religion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maegan-hall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-561076-html.html>Maegan Hall Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maegan-hall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-561076-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
