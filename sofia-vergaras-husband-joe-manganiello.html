His biggest production to date was Stanley Kowalski in the 2008 production of A Streetcar Named Desire.</p><p>Manganiello got his big break in 2009 when he was cast as Alcide Herveaux in True Blood. He would star on the show for five years, becoming one of the most popular actors on the production.</p><p>He was already a fan of the show prior to his casting and studied the novels intensely to play Alcide as accurately as possible.</p><p>Manganiello went back to the world of filmmaking as an actor in Magic Mike and in the director’s chair for films and television.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>His Love Story With Sofia Vergara&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Vergara was still engaged to businessman and actor Nick Loeb in 2014 when she attended the White House Correspondent’s Dinner on May 3.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she was on the arm of another man, Manganiello could not help but be intrigued by the actress.</p><p><strong>“I totally got busted,” </strong>he recalled to E! News. <strong>“We had talked, I guess, or kinda bumped into each other but we didn’t start dating until she was single. She had a boyfriend at that time, so I probably could’ve gotten into a fight for doing that. I’m not trying to start a fight at the White House.”</strong></p><p>The two began dating in secret the following month, just after Vergara had announced her split from Loeb.</p><p>She claimed she had asked Modern Family costar Jesse Tyler Ferguson for Manganiello’s number, and the rest was history.</p><p>Their whirlwind romance had people talking for months, especially after Manganiello proposed just six months after they had begun dating.</p><p>Manganiello had planned on proposing while the couple vacationed in Hawaii, but after the paparazzi got wind of his potential plans.</p><p>Scrambling to rectify the situation, the actor decided to take the plunge and propose in the couple’s suite.</p><p>He recounted the story in Haute Living, saying:</p><p><strong>“We had this big bay window [that I opened up], and the sun was going down pink over the mountains and over the bay, and I had this ring. I had looked at every ring in the world, and this is the ring that I wanted. I had a whole speech prepared in Spanish. I proposed to her on one knee in Spanish with the sun going down. It was awesome.”</strong></p><p>Excited to become the husband of Sofia Vergara, Manganiello and his bride walked down the aisle in November of 2015.</p><p>Since then, he has had no issues with being known as ‘Sofia Vergara’s husband and routinely gushes about his superstar wife on social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Plans For Their Future</strong></h2><p>Vergara, who has been engaged in a series of lengthy legal battles over the rights of her frozen embryos, has discussed the possibility of children with Manganiello.</p><p>At 18, she gave birth to her son Manolo, who she shares with ex-husband Joe Gonzalez.</p><p>Having been a single mother for most of her life, Vergara has repeatedly expressed her admiration for her husband’s abilities as a stepfather.</p><p>When asked about plans for future children, Vergara <a href=#>spoke</a> honestly about her present circumstances:</p><p><strong>“My husband is [four years] younger than me and he wants kids so we’re trying to figure out what we’re going to do,” </strong>the actress explained.<strong> “The idea of doing it all again doesn’t scare me but, hey, it’s not like it’s going to happen naturally, is it?”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2Fzp%2BgmmWmmr%2BordGaqmagpaivorrDZqGonV2irq%2BzwKegnqScpHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsofia-vergaras-husband-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsofia-vergaras-husband-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsofia-vergaras-husband-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsofia-vergaras-husband-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsofia-vergaras-husband-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsofia-vergaras-husband-joe-manganiello.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hum-nutrition-beauty-sleep-gummies-melatonin-digestion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hum-nutrition-beauty-sleep-gummies-melatonin-digestion.html>Get Beauty Sleep With These Gummies From Hum Nutrition</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./evan-prater-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-138449-html.html>Evan Prater Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./evan-prater-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-138449-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
