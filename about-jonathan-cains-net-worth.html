Under his stage name, Johnatan Cain is a musician, singer/songwriter, best known as the keyboardist in bands like The Babys, Journey and Bad English.</p><p>Johnatan Cain’s net worth is estimated at $30 million as of mid-2016, accumulated thanks to his work in popular British and American rock groups during his successful musical career now spanning over 40 years. His cooperation with other famous musicians has only added to his net worth, and since he is still an active musician, his net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Jonathan Cain Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>Cain began his musical education at the age of eight when he started taking accordion lessons. By the time he was a teenager, he had already begun playing accordion and piano at clubs and private parties. Currently, he also plays guitar, bass, and harmonica. Jonathan went to East Leyden High School and then survived the fire at Our Lady of the Angels School in 1958—a tragedy that took away around 100 lives.</p><p>He perfected his musical knowledge at the Chicago Conservatory of Music before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, and eventually to Los Angeles, California. Cain released his first record album in 1976 as the Jonathan Cain Band and joined The Babys rock band three years later. He worked with this group on two of their albums, “Union Jacks” and “On the Edge”, before leaving them in 1980 when he decided to join the Journey band. Jonathan composed and played the piano on numerous songs from Journey’s album “Escape”, such as “Don’t Stop Believin”, described as one of the best opening keyboard riffs in rock music by AllMusic, which helped them rise to the top of the charts. However, Cain best distinguished himself as the solo composer of the classic Journey ballad “Faithfully”. Another one of his successful compositions is “Working Class Man” song, sung by Jimmy Barnes.</p><p>After another eleven albums released with Journey, Jonathan reunited with his former bandmates from the Babys, and Neal Schon and drummer Deen Castronovo from Journey to form a new band called Bad English. However, they only released two albums before disbanding. Journey’s lineup from the “Escape” album reunited in 1996 to record the “Trial by Fire” album. Two years later, the band’s lead singer, Steve Perry, left the band due to health problems and since then, Journey has had three successive singers. Cain started a tradition of performing a piano solo at every Journey concert and is known for usually playing the same solo each time, having changed it only four times since 1998. All his activities contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Apart from his band career, Jonathan has released eight solo albums and contributed to Neal Schon’s solo album to a large degree. He has also established a recording studio “Addiction Sound” in Nashville.</p><p>Jonathan has been married three times, firstly to singer Tane McClure in the 1980s, then to Elizabeth Yvette Fullerton in 1089 with whom he has three children, and he has been married to minister Paula White since April 2015. Jonathan now resides in Nashville.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jonathan Cain</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 26, 1950</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Film Score Composer, Singer-songwriter, Keyboard Player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>East Leyden High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Paula White</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Liza Cain, Weston Cain, Madison Cain</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/jonathancainmusic</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/thejonathancain</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/jonathancainmusic/</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>https://myspace.com/jonathancainmusic</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0128916/</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jonathan-cain-mn0000261932</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Former member of The Babys.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>His birthday is the day before that of Journey band mate Neal Schon.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Cain is a survivor of the December 1, 1958 Our Lady of the Angels school fire in Chicago.
