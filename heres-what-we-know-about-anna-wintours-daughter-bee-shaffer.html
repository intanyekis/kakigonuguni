Yes, <a href=#><strong>Anna Wintour</strong> isn't just a tough critic</a>, she's also a hip mother and - wait for it - grandmother. Imagine having the world's grandest and most lavish fashion icon as your mom or grandmother? The editor-in-chief of American Vogue and <a href=#>Met Gala organizer</a> will soon be a grandmother for the third time, which means she'll soon be able to buy tiny designer clothes... again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Things Anna Wintour Has Admitted To Disliking</a></span></p><p>While fashion enthusiasts may know intricate details of the fashion queen's life, many don't know much about her successful daughter, Bee Shaffer. And although Wintour is known for her signature look featuring her dark frames and her unchanged hairstyle, her daughter is without a doubt her offspring. The two look so alike, it's hard to believe that the posh Wintour is actually a mother, as they look more like sisters. But besides both being comely, we want to share what there's to know about Shaffer.</p><p>Let us take a peek at Wintour's only daughter's life!</p><h2 id=got-it-from-her-mama><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Got It From Her Mama</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're as obsessed with Wintour as we are, you already know that her head hits the pillow at 10:15 p.m. sharp! And as one of the most successful women in the fashion industry for over two decades, she's definitely doing something right.</p><p>Well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, and Shaffer has admitted to taking on her mother's strict habit! When Shaffer sat down to chat with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>, she admitted, "The one thing I inherited from my mom is that I really like to go to bed early." If Anna Wintour was our mother, we'd probably do the same.</p><h2 id=make-the-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Make The Time</span></h2><p>What else has Shaffer learned from her blunt fashion icon mother? To always show up and to show up on time!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being late for whatever reason doesn't necessarily fly with Wintour, and neither does it with her only daughter. Tardiness is not in her blood, as she was brought up to always be punctual. Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>, Shaffer shed some light on what it was like growing up under American Vogue's helm, saying, "I'm very punctual, it was how I was raised. It's so easy to be on time, you've just got to make time for things."</p><p>And yes, that includes making certain she's on time at her mother's yearly Met Gala, despite the extravagant outfit she may have to put on.</p><h2 id=tight-knit-relationship><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tight-Knit Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anna Wintour may seem like the most intimidating woman in the world, but when it comes to her children - Bee has a brother named Charles - Wintour is kind and soft.</p><p>The film The Devil Wears Prada, which is loosely based on Wintour, features Meryl Streep playing her, and the one thing the movie failed to show was how Wintour would bring her sole daughter to work with her. Let's be honest, if Wintour was our mother, we certainly wouldn't have minded "Take Our Kids To Work Day."</p><p>Wintour chimed in on her role as a mother, citing it was important for Shaffer to see that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">women work as hard as men.</a> The head of Vogue mentioned, "I would try to take them with me when I could just so they could experience and see a little bit of what a work day involved."</p><h2 id=not-a-fashionista><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Not A Fashionista</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surprisingly, Shaffer didn't follow in her mother's style footsteps!</p><p>Although she's her mother's doppelgänger and certainly cleans up nicely, her love for fashion doesn't match her iconic mother's. Wintour's unbridled enthusiasm for fashion didn't impact her daughter as much as one would think. Shaffer, the brunette beauty, spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a> on her fashion sense, stating she's quite the polar opposite of her mom. "I’ve never been very fashion-forward. I kind of wear the same thing all the time..." We're not sure if the woman behind the heavy black sunglasses agrees!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Anna Wintour Is Wearing Sweatpants And Confirms Fashion Can't Go Back</a></span></p><h2 id=anna-wintour-2><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Anna Wintour #2</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She did follow in her mother's footsteps when it came to her career path, though.</p><p>Shaffer has journalism in her DNA, so just like the American Vogue editor-in-chief, Shaffer spent her schooling studying journalism. She explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a> her decision to pursue the field, saying, "My grandfather was an editor and my uncle is an editor. Obviously, my mom is an editor." It's clearly all in the family.</p><p>Who knows, maybe when Wintour decides to let the sunglasses go and let the hair grow, Shaffer will take her mother's infamous role in the fashion world.</p><h2 id=an-entertainment-gig><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>An Entertainment Gig</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upon completing her education, Shaffer didn't show up at Vogue's door expecting a job. Instead, the independent and hardworking woman ended up in the entertainment industry.</p><p>As the daughter of one of the most influential fashion editors, Shaffer took another route and ended up landing an equally exciting job on Late Night with Seth Meyers. For nearly four years, Shaffer was the producer of the American talk show. It proved to be a memorable working experience, as when Shaffer departed the show, she posted a photo via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> with the caption, "Thank you, @latenightseth, for an unforgettable three-and-a-half years. What an amazing opportunity to meet so many Hamilton cast members."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Spill The Tea On On Anna Wintour As 'New Yorker' Employees Protest Outside Her House</a></span></p><h2 id=ms-to-mrs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ms. To Mrs.</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bee Shaffer has a ring on her finger and has taken on the Carrozzini surname!</p><p>The Columbia graduate has been a married woman since 2018, calling Francesco Carrozzini her Italian stallion. The pair was first linked in 2016, and it was right away a match made in fashion heaven; Carrozzini's late mother was Vogue Italia‘s editor-in-chief. In 2018, they went ahead and made things official by tying the knot in an intimate ceremony in Wintour's lavish New York home. Details of their nuptials are scattered, as according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, phones and the use of social media was disallowed.</p><h2 id=a-baby-on-the-way><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Baby On The Way</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amid a worldwide pandemic, Shaffer announced in July that she and husband Francesco Carrozzini are expecting their first child!</p><p>The fashionable mom-to-be is glowing and got to show off her princess gown at her mother's annual big bash - the Met Gala - with a baby bump. Leave it to the granddaughter of the Vogue icon to make an appearance at the coveted event before even being born. The baby is undoubtedly going to have the fashion gene!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Are Anna Wintour And Bill Nighy Dating?
