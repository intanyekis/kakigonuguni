<time>22 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Giada De Laurentiis is happily dating her long-time partner&nbsp;Shane Farley. The relationship only came to existence after she&nbsp;went&nbsp;through a&nbsp;high profile divorce with her husband of two decades,&nbsp;Todd Thompson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Read on to know more about her married life, divorce, and current relationship with her partner!</p><h2>Laurentiis Separated with Husband in Amicable Terms</h2><p>Laurentiis&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;her longtime boyfriend, a fashion designer by profession, Todd Thompson, in May 2003. They tied the knots through&nbsp;an Italian wedding ceremony. Five years after, in March 2008, the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter Jade Marie De Laurentiis-Thompson.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Justine Schofield Wiki: Age, Married, Partner, Family | Explicit Details</a></p><p>But, 25 years of togetherness and the presence of a daughter couldn't save their marriage from crumbling down. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a>&nbsp;living separately in July&nbsp;2014 and filed a divorce petition in&nbsp; December 2014. The&nbsp;Italian-American chef even announced the divorce through her Facebook on December 30, 2014, and stated that the separation was an amicable decision. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The divorce settlement was one of the most expensive at the time, with her husband <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">receiving</a>&nbsp;$2 million and $9,000 a month for child support.</p><h2>She Found Love Again</h2><p>A year and a half from her divorce, in 2013, the foodie diva <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a>&nbsp;the television producer Shane Farley. She was to collaborate with him to produce a talk show. Due to that, her relationship with Farley was strictly professional at first. However, the frequent meetings sprouted a feeling between her and her partner, and the two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">began</a>&nbsp;dating at the end of 2015.</p><p>For Laurentiis, the relationship gave her a new lease on life. After spending close to a quarter of a century with Thompson, she "felt&nbsp;like a kid again" to have a fresh start again. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Walking Down Beach: Giada De Laurentiis with daughter Jade and boyfriend Shane Farley in 2018 </strong>(Photo: PEOPLE)</p><p>Their relationship got fortified by their communal <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">love</a>&nbsp;for Italian food and the approval from Laurentiis' daughter, Jade. Jade can be seen spending quality time with&nbsp;Laurentiis and Farley.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Anne Burrell, Lesbian Restaurant Owner Chef Weight Loss Secret Ousted</a></p><h2>COVID's Quarantine Strengthened Her Bond with Boyfriend</h2><p>While the pandemic hit hard on everyone's life, it helped people get back with family and reconnect&nbsp;with loved ones. It was the same scenario for&nbsp;Laurentiis. She used the quarantine time to spend her time with her boyfriend Farley in California. Moreover, she shot her latest show,&nbsp;Giada At Home 2.0,&nbsp;with help from Farley in the camera work.</p><p>While talking to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in 2020 about her quarantine, she said that she never had a chance to spend such a long time with her partner before. The Food Network star then&nbsp;stated that the quarantine had made her bond with her boyfriend stronger.</p><p>I think it's made us stronger. Truly. I think that's what happens sometimes in these things. You either become stronger or you start to say like, 'Ah, I can't do this.' So it's been fun.</p><p>Moreover, she mentioned her daughter and said that the quarantine helped her know her daughter on a deeper level. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Laurentiis Looked Back at More Simples Times</h2><p>On 8 November 2018, Giada shared a beautiful throwback from her life as a mom with daughter Jade.&nbsp;The picture showed Giada embracing a navy tracksuit while feeding her daughter a bottle.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Beautiful Moment Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow: Giada posts an old picture of her bottle-feeding her daughter on Instagram.</strong> (Photo: Giada De Laurentiis' Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She covered the caption with her disbelief at the fact that her daughter was so small. She wrote, '#tbt hard to believe she was ever this small. #mommymoments #mygirl.'</p><p><strong>Discover:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Todd Thompson Age 54 Wiki: Divorce Bumps Net Worth; Dating Status Now</a></p><p>Jade, on the other hand, has not only grown up to look like her mother, but she has also taken after her in cooking as well. In fact, the chef opened up to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in March 2018 about how her daughter loved to fiddle with kitchen stuff,</p><p>I bought Jade a little purple ceramic knife and she just loves it. She's like 'What can I chop? What can I cut?' It makes her excited about what she's going to make, and then she's more apt to actually try new things and eat her dinner.</p><h2>Laurentiis' Journey To Fame</h2><p>The&nbsp;face of Food Network, Laurentiis, presents various shows on the channel. Apart from hosting the Giada at Home, she also is a frequent guest co-host on NBC's Today.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Kitchen Love: Giada De Laurentiis with Rachael Ray on show Giada's Italy on April 13, 2018</strong> (Photo: Giada De Laurentiis' Instagram)</p><p>As a child, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">found</a>&nbsp;herself going to the kitchen frequently. Her grandfather owned a restaurant, and she made numerous visits to the restaurant, which led her to dream of owning a restaurant.&nbsp;After studying at Le Cordon bleu, she aimed to be a pastry chef.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Meet Katie Lee's Spoiling Boyfriend/Husband-To-Be!

Her TV&nbsp;journey&nbsp;started in 2003 after she hosted the Food Network's show&nbsp;Everyday Italian.</p><p>After that, she has hosted&nbsp;Behind the Bash&nbsp;and&nbsp;Giada's Weekend Getaways&nbsp;with the network. She also hosted the 2007&nbsp;Food network Awards and appeared as a judge on various cooking shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from a career in TV, Laurentiis'&nbsp;business interest expands to restaurants. She owns two restaurants,&nbsp;Giada opened in 2014 at the Cromwell, and&nbsp;Pronto by Giada at the Caesars Palace, which opened doors for the customers in February 2018. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her TV career has become one of the most recognized celebrity chefs and considerable net worth.&nbsp;The TV personality/ businesswomen, through her business ventures, have earned a whopping net worth of $20 million.</p><h2>A Look at Her Bio</h2><p>Chef Laurentiis&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born </a>on August 22, 1970, in an Italian&nbsp;family whose roots ran deep into Hollywood. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is</a>&nbsp;the eldest daughter of Veronica De Laurentiis&nbsp;and her first husband, actor/producer, Alex De Benedetti. Her maternal grandfather and grandmother were also Italian actors.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>As a child, she was reluctant to pursue her family traditions of being in front of the camera and labeled herself as a camera-shy person. However, as fate would have it, Giada continued the family's legacy, albeit not acting but fronting up the camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnl56upa2MnZxmpJGqv6a606KgrGWYqsCjrc2dZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMm6aynqKesq%2BwjJ2YraGenHqvsdNmrqiqpJ16pa3UoJ%2BtnaJixKaww6KloGaYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgiada-de-laurentiis-husband-divorce-boyfriend-dating-net-worth-daughter-wedding-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgiada-de-laurentiis-husband-divorce-boyfriend-dating-net-worth-daughter-wedding-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgiada-de-laurentiis-husband-divorce-boyfriend-dating-net-worth-daughter-wedding-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgiada-de-laurentiis-husband-divorce-boyfriend-dating-net-worth-daughter-wedding-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgiada-de-laurentiis-husband-divorce-boyfriend-dating-net-worth-daughter-wedding-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgiada-de-laurentiis-husband-divorce-boyfriend-dating-net-worth-daughter-wedding-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./julie-chavez-rodriguez-wikipedia-age-biography-and-husband-is-she-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./julie-chavez-rodriguez-wikipedia-age-biography-and-husband-is-she-married.html>Julie Chavez Rodriguez Wikipedia, Age Biography and Husband: Is She Married?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emil-sitka.html>Emil Sitka</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emil-sitka.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
