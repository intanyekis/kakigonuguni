The two stars dated from 2007 until 2013 and everyone surely remembers that their love story&nbsp;had a bad turn when things ended&nbsp;in assault in 2009.</p><p>However, even after that, the two were rumored to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still be&nbsp;a thing</a> and those rumors only cooled down in 2013.
