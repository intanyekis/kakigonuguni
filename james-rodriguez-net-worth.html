His career has been active since 2006.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich James Rodriguez is, as of early 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Taylor’s net worth is over $30 million, accumulated through his successful involvement in the sports industry as a professional soccer player.</p><h3><strong>James Rodríguez Net Worth $30 Million</strong></h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>James Rodriguez was raised in Ibagué, Tolima, the son of Maria Del Pilar Rubio and Wilson James Rodriguez Bedoya, who was also a professional soccer player and member of the Colombian national team. Thus as a little kid, he showed affinity with soccer, and through constant practice became very skillful.</p><p>As very talented teenager, James started his professional career in 2006, when he signed for Columbian team Envigado and competed with them in the second division. The following year, the team was promoted to the first division, which marked the beginning of an increase of his net worth.</p><p>Subsequently, in 2008 James went to Argentina and signed a contract with Banfield in Argentina’s first division, and quickly he became a regular first team player, appearing in every game. During the next year, his goal in the game against Newell’s Old Boys earned his team the Argentinian Championship for the first time. Moreover, in 2010, James participated for the first time in The Copa Libertadores, a prestige soccer tournament for the trophy of South America, which added a considerable amount to his net worth.</p><p>In the new millennium, James continued to line up successes, signing a contract worth $5.1 million over the next four years with Portuguese team Porto. In his first season there, the team won the 2011 Taça de Portugal Final as well as the Europa League. During the 2011-2012 season he won the LPFP Award for Breakthrough Player Primeira Liga, and then the Portuguese Golden Ball award in 2012, increasing his net worth by a large margin. In the next season, he appeared in 24 games and scored 10 goals.</p><p>In May of 2013, James was transferred to French Championship club AS Monaco for $45 million, one of the most expensive transfers in the history of soccer. In the following year, James led the team to the victory at Coupe de France, including scoring a goal, after which he was named in the media as the best player of the league, increasing his potential net worth further. He also ensured the club’s participation in UEFA Champions League in the next season.</p><p>To speak further about his career, James signed a contract worth $80 million with Spanish team Real Madrid in 2014, which contributed a lot to his net worth. He scored his first goal for the team in the Spanish Super Cup, against Atlético Madrid, and during his stint there, the team won the UEFA Champions League in the 2015-2016 and the 2016-2017 seasons, and won the 2016-2017 La Liga. Most recently, James was loaned to German first league team Bayern Munich and he still plays there. His net worth is certainly still rising.</p><p>Additionally, James Rodriguez also has an international soccer career, playing for the Colombian national team since 2007. Thanks partly to him, the team finished as the runners-up in the 2007 South American Under-17 Championships, as he scored three goals, won the 2011 Toulon Tournament, and finished third in the 2016 Copa América, again increasing his potential net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, James Rodriguez was married to Daniela Ospina (2011-2017), a famous volleyball player; the couple had a daughter together.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOYpp2jYr%2BwsNGinq6dqmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-rodriguez-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-rodriguez-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-rodriguez-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-rodriguez-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-rodriguez-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-rodriguez-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-my-big-boobs-have-always-served-me-well-201273.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-love-hewitt-my-big-boobs-have-always-served-me-well-201273.html>Jennifer Love Hewitt: My Big Boobs Have &amp;quot;Always Served Me Well&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fashion-industry-mourns-the-loss-of-ivan-bartivan-bart-cause-of-death-remember.html>Fashion Industry Mourns the Loss of Ivan Bart, Former President of IMG Models</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fashion-industry-mourns-the-loss-of-ivan-bartivan-bart-cause-of-death-remember.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
