When it comes to status symbols, Louis Vuitton blows other designers out of the water. The iconic monogram has worked its way onto celebrity arms, private jets, collaborations, and most of hip-hop. A$AP Rocky has dropped the LV name more times than we can count, although there is a figure for Kanye West â€“ he has mentioned Louis Vuitton 19 separate times in his songs. With Emma Stone as the brand's face and every celeb flight coming with a Louis Vuitton entourage, those expensive leathers are more "in" than ever.</p><p>Lady Gaga has described her hair as "Louis Vuitton brown." Ariana Grande has worn a Louis Vuitton monogrammed skirt (complete with cute matching cat ears). Those pics of Justin Bieber being a gentleman and helping Hailey Baldwin with her luggage? Three guesses which brand the suitcases were. Some celebs keep Louis Vuitton as an occasional wear. Most of them are far too in love with the brand to keep it to a one-off, though. Put it this way. The 2018 Louis Vuitton menswear show in Paris had as much focus on the front-row celebs as it did on the runway's models. From the rap artists wearing LV kicks to the reality stars dripping in accessories, here are 25 celebs who are just loving Louis Vuitton in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-chooses-her-accessories-carefully><strong>TAYLOR SWIFT&nbsp;CHOOSES HER ACCESSORIES CAREFULLY</strong></h2><p>Taylor Swift is one of the most casual celebs around. You're looking at a multi-millionaire who still walks around in $60 Converse. These ladies up the ante when it comes to the biggest fashion event of the year, though. While other celebs will choose Versace or Chanel for NYC's annual Met Gala, Taylor Swift went with Louis Vuitton for her 2016 appearance. How has the singer filled the last two years? One Louis Vuitton purse after the other. This is just one of them.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-keeps-it-minimal><strong>ARIANA GRANDE KEEPS IT MINIMAL</strong></h2><p>Ariana Grande is all about the opposites. You're looking at a pint-sized singer with a power of a voice, and that metaphor pretty much sums Ariana up. Bubblegum pop and a sweetheart vibe make up one half of Ariana. Attractive endorsement potential (that Reebok is making the most of) is the other half. Ariana is releasing her Sweetener album at the same time as she is making headlines for her whirlwind engagement to Pete Davidson. Here she is showing us lots of love (and a little Louis Vuitton). Earlier this year, Ariana wore matching LV cat ears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kimye-wore-louis-vuitton-to-the-2018-paris-show><strong>KIMYE WORE LOUIS VUITTON TO THE 2018 PARIS SHOW</strong></h2><p>Please. It isn't a fashion show without Kim Kardashian taking her front row seat. You might not be seeing the iconic monogram here, but these outfits are Louis Vuitton. Kim, Kanye West, and Kylie Jenner wore bold blues and bright yellows to the 2018 Louis Vuitton menswear show in Paris, and they definitely got noticed. Workman-like as this look is, it is expensive. These jumpsuits cost a pretty penny.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-takes-his-love-to-another-level><strong>DJ KHALED TAKES HIS LOVE TO ANOTHER LEVEL</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Louis Vuitton announced its collaboration with the sports giant, Supreme. The result was a bold red range of luggage, shoes, holdall bags, and a big celeb following. DJ Khaled looked pretty pleased with himself here in a Louis Vuitton x Supreme hoodie, statement bag, and Air Jordan 11 sneakers. Justin Bieber wore a shirt with the same logo at a 2018 concert. The LV Supreme range comes at a price, though. Logo shirts cost over $500. Trunks cost over $50,000.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-raps-about-it><strong>NICKI MINAJ RAPS ABOUT IT</strong></h2><p>Fans will be likely already be aware that Nicki Minaj is a lady who loves her fashion. Her 2018 gift from Chanel led to a literal meltdown of joy on Snapchat, but Nicki's heart will always have a place for Louis Vuitton. Her "Whip It" track made it very clear, as did making sure that Louis Vuitton accompanied her to this game. Google "Nicki Minaj + Louis Vuitton" at your own risk. You will get thousands of results.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I don't mean to brag, I Louis Vuitton bag 'em," Nicki Minaj&nbsp;raps in "Whip It."</strong></p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-personalizes-her-lv-bags><strong>KENDALL JENNER PERSONALIZES HER LV BAGS</strong></h2><p>When Forbes announces that you were the highest-paid model of 2017, chances are you can afford to upgrade from the basic bag. A Louis Vuitton Speedy Bag retails for over $1500 as a starting price. Kendall Jenner's personalized "Bore Me Please" Speedy? That can easily cost up to $20,000. Kendall has stepped out in LV wallets, cross-body bags, and miniature clutches... right through to giant airport suitcases. This is a girl who knows her fashion. Louis Vuitton isn't a brand that Kendall will ignore.</p><h2 id=rita-ora-likes-it-matching><strong>RITA ORA LIKES IT MATCHING</strong></h2><p>Not many celebs nail the matching LV look without it feeling overdone. Rita Ora was in the Italian city of Verona here in 2018, where she channeled a casual denim vibe with a Louis Vuitton edge. Her denim jacket and matching skirt nicely offset the lime green tee and white sneakers, and we have to say, it's a great look. Rita is regularly spotted with other Louis Vuitton items, including purses and shirts. Of course, Rita also attended the 2018 Louis Vuitton fashion show in Paris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-has-been-the-face-of-louis-vuitton><strong>SELENA GOMEZ HAS BEEN THE FACE OF LOUIS VUITTON</strong></h2><p>There are the celebrities who will put their face to any brand. Powerful as her endorsement power is, Selena Gomez isn't a girl who sells out easily. Only putting her face to brands she actually loves, Selena may be best known for her current Coach collaborations, but let's not forget that she was the face of Louis Vuitton in 2016. When the campaign surfaced, Vogue wrote an entire article documenting Selena's love of Louis Vuitton. Sleek, sophisticated, and beautiful, Selena was a perfect choice here.</p><h2 id=drake-created-the-soundtrack-to-the-louis-vuitton-show><strong>DRAKE CREATED THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE LOUIS VUITTON SHOW</strong></h2><p>Drake is a busy guy. One day, he's randomly shelling out $50,000 to pay for everyone's groceries in a Miami store. The next, he's writing songs for Louis Vuitton. Yup, in 2017, Drake wrote an entire song for the Louis Vuitton runway show. "Signs" was written just for Louis Vuitton. Drake has also been spotted in a blue monogrammed shirt, plus this luggage piece (which is a little more low-key).</p><p><strong>In 2017, Drake premiered "Signs" â€“ a song specifically written for the Louis Vuitton fashion show.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna-wears-lv-looks-before-they-hit-stores><strong>RIHANNA WEARS LV LOOKS BEFORE THEY HIT STORES</strong></h2><p>To be fair, when you're famous on Rihanna's level, you're going to get some perks. Rihanna has evolved from singer to beauty and fashion iconâ€“ her Fenty beauty line is set to out-sell KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics, according to Business Insider. In 2018, Rihanna wore Virgil Abloh's Louis Vuitton jumpsuit before anyone knew that it existed. Yes, RiRi was at the 2018 Louis Vuitton fashion show in Paris. Here she is with a trusted favorite: the Louis Vuitton purse that retails for over $2000.</p><h2 id=kevin-hart-takes-it-one-step-further><strong>KEVIN HART TAKES IT ONE STEP FURTHER</strong></h2><p>When it comes to celeb sneaker collections, Kevin Hart is a clear winner. "I'm probably at 500 or 600 pairs," he told Vogue. That was back in 2016. Kevin isn't wearing Louis Vuitton here, but he's loving the brand a different way. Kevin is wearing the famed OFF-WHITE x Nike Air Max 97. The link? OFF-WHITE is the fresh brand from the Louis Vuitton menswear head, Virgil Abloh. FYI, this guy does shoots with Kendall and is on every celeb's invite list.</p><h2 id=emma-watson-s-vuitton-bags-are-less-obvious><strong>EMMA WATSON'S VUITTON BAGS ARE LESS OBVIOUS</strong></h2><p>Everything about Emma Watson is understated. That's why we love her so much. You'll never see Emma with a face caked in two inches of makeup and&nbsp;spider lashes. You likewise won't see her in ultra-revealing dresses. Fully matching Emma's understated beauty, is her love of understated Louis Vuitton. $4,850 is the retail price for this Louis Vuitton SC bag, but you won't see the monogram on this model. Emma has also worn Louis Vuitton dresses to major events (again, without the monogram).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-finds-happiness-in-louis-vuitton><strong>KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN FINDS HAPPINESS IN LOUIS VUITTON</strong></h2><p>Kourtney Kardashian is going through somewhat of a hard time right now. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians&nbsp;season 15 trailer saw Kim say: "It's like she doesn't even want to be a Kardashian anymore" about her older sister. At the same time, The Daily Mail is reporting that Kourt's now ex-boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, has left her. This mom of three is still super stylish, though. Her smart or casual looks are always on-trend, as is this cute Louis Vuitton backpack. Kourt's kids have even been seen with mini LV bags.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-is-a-louis-vuitton-gentleman><strong>JUSTIN BIEBER IS A LOUIS VUITTON GENTLEMAN</strong></h2><p>Justin Bieber has been front-page news ever since he announced his engagement to the model, Hailey Baldwin. These two are now inseparable, from their cozy Instagram snaps to their travels. Justin was being quite the gentleman here by helping Hailey with her luggage, but it wasn't any old luggage. You're looking at a Louis Vuitton Keepall, which retails for $3,600. Justin has also worn a Louis Vuitton x Supreme monogrammed shirt on stage. In 2017, Justin's Snapchat showed us a Louis Vuitton skateboard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-keeps-a-cool-head-with-louis-vuitton><strong>KYLIE JENNER KEEPS A COOL HEAD WITH LOUIS VUITTON</strong></h2><p>The list of purses owned by Kylie Jenner would take up all the bandwidth in the world if we tried to type it out. $1 million is what People estimated Kylie's purse collection to be worthâ€“ and yes, it's packed with Louis Vuitton. Kylie has just celebrated her 21st birthday, but her love for Louis Vuitton goes way back. Kylie chose an LV bandana for her Kylie Cosmetics promotional pic, and everything from her swimwear to her luggage has the iconic monogram.</p><p><strong>There are 30.5 million results for #LouisVuitton on Instagram. Kylie is likely contributing to a lot of them.</strong></p><h2 id=spot-the-louis-vuitton-slides-on-demi-lovato><strong>SPOT THE LOUIS VUITTON SLIDES ON DEMI LOVATO</strong></h2><p>Every single fan out there is rooting for Demi Lovato right now. The brave and beautiful singer has been very public about her personal troubles â€“ being honest and open as well as being a fantastic artist will earn you a lot of respect. Demi has worn quite the range of Louis Vuitton gear over the years, although it's never overdone. In 2017, Demi was spotted with a Louis Vuitton purse. More recently, she wore LV slides with a super-casual sweats look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gigi-hadid-is-photographed-inside-louis-vuitton-stores><strong>GIGI HADID IS PHOTOGRAPHED INSIDE LOUIS VUITTON STORES</strong></h2><p>And she literally can't seem to decide. Given the huge range of fresh kicks that Louis Vuitton has alongside its regular shoes, boots, bags, and accessories, we don't blame her. Gigi Hadid was&nbsp;photographed at this Louis Vuitton store in NYC, where FootwearNews reported that she tried on LV's newest High Arch sneaker. This shoe is super futuristic â€“ they are definitely one of the more "out there" sneakers, but they're beautiful. Gigi is equally seen with a full LV entourage for her quick outings about town.</p><h2 id=jaden-smith-has-done-official-vuitton-campaigns><strong>JADEN SMITH HAS DONE OFFICIAL VUITTON CAMPAIGNS</strong></h2><p>They grow up fast, right? Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith are proud parents to two very famous (and very stylish) teens. Jaden Smith is a futuristic celebrity with 9.8 million Instagram followers and some major muscle. In 2016, Jaden was the face of Louis Vuitton, with NY Times calling him "The New Man In A Skirt." Jaden's 2018 looks have included Louis Vuitton's ultra-cool sneakers, plus a ton of accessories and clothing. Jaden was also&nbsp;seen at the 2018 Louis Vuitton show in Paris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jlo-has-the-same-louis-vuitton-bag-as-taylor-swift><strong>JLO HAS THE SAME LOUIS VUITTON BAG AS TAYLOR SWIFT</strong></h2><p>Being one of the highest-paid celebrities around will afford you some luxuries. Jennifer Lopez earned $38 million in 2017, according to Forbes. The singer, dancer, and American Idol judge has also been the face of Louis Vuitton, although this was way back in 2003. More recently, J-Lo&nbsp;has been spotted carrying this Louis Vuitton x Christian Louboutin Shopper Tote â€“ the exact same one that you saw Taylor Swift carrying earlier up. Consider this just a fraction of Jen's LV collection.</p><h2 id=louis-vuitton-is-paying-emma-stone-big-bucks><strong>LOUIS VUITTON IS PAYING EMMA STONE BIG BUCKS</strong></h2><p>Those celeb endorsements cost brands millions. In Emma Stone's case, that figure sits at an estimated $12.8 million, according to News.com. The Oscar-winning actress signed a two-year contract with the luggage giant in 2017, and her face is all over the Louis Vuitton billboards. Classy, beautiful, humble, and talented, Emma was the perfect choice for 2018. Emma's personal Louis Vuitton choices have leaned more towards clothing than bags, but still...that contract.</p><p><strong>$12.8 million is the estimated worth of Emma Stone's Louis Vuitton contract.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blac-chyna-has-a-louis-vuitton-phone-case><strong>BLAC CHYNA HAS A LOUIS VUITTON PHONE CASE</strong></h2><p>Blac Chyna was never one to keep a low profile. The reality star and baby momma to Rob Kardashian's little girl, Dream is reportedly suing the Kardashians after the Rob & Chyna show was axed. The Daily Mail reported this a while back, but most of Blac Chyna's headlines are about her eye-popping outfits. Keeping it casual here, Chyna showed us her love of Louis Vuitton with her phone case. iPhone cases from Louis Vuitton are so expensive, the website doesn't even list a price.</p><h2 id=scott-disick-likes-it-loud><strong>SCOTT DISICK LIKES IT LOUD</strong></h2><p>Scott Disick never advertised himself as not having confidence. The man who refers to himself as "The Lord" is a reality star, an entrepreneur, a dad, and a male fashion icon. His suave style often includes high-end brands like Versace and Gucci, although this Louis Vuitton x Supreme look went down the French route. Louis Vuitton shirts can easily cost $500. Then again, when you're a high-earning celeb with millions in the bank, a little LV shopping won't do much damage.</p><h2 id=the-beckhams-keep-it-in-the-family><strong>THE BECKHAMS KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY</strong></h2><p>Victoria Beckham is arguably the first pop star to make it as a bonafide fashion icon. The former Spice Girl has replaced her former bodycon dresses and fake tans for a far more sophisticated look â€“ like this one. Victoria Beckham designs have been worn by the biggest celebs and A-listers, and Victoria herself is classy as they come. She does adore Louis Vuitton, as does her son, Romeo. Cruz Beckham has even updated his social media in an LV shirt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-the-cool-kids-are-in-louis-vuitton-kicks><strong>ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE IN LOUIS VUITTON KICKS</strong></h2><p>Louis Vuitton may best be known for its luggage, but the footwear isn't far behind. Virgil Abloh is the creative director of menswear (and the creator of the OFF-WHITE x Converse sneakers). He is also the man behind Louis Vuitton's sensational sneaker range. At the lower end, you're looking at $800 for a pair. The newest ones don't even have a price. Kendall Jenner, Jaden Smith, and Hailey Baldwin make their point here as "the cool kids."</p><p><strong>Selena Gomez, Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin, and Kendall Jenner are all fans of LV kicks.</strong></p><h2 id=sjp-knows-which-brands-to-respect><strong>SJP KNOWS WHICH BRANDS TO RESPECT</strong></h2><p>Sarah Jessica Parker's Sex and The City days may be over, but the fashionista is alive and well. Much like her Carrie Bradshaw character, SJP is a complete fashion nut, and she even has her own shoe line. Now a busy mom and businesswoman, Sarah is mostly seen&nbsp;around NYC. This time, she was&nbsp;photographed with a summery yellow LV purse.</p><p>You've got 25 celebs all proving that Louis Vuitton is the brand of 2018.
