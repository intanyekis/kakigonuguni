After turning 50 this spring, she's looking ahead to the next chapter in her career, all too aware that aging can be the downfall of many actresses' careers as they are replaced by younger ingenues at the beginning of their careers. <a href=#>Idina Menzel</a>, however, looks exactly the same as she did 15 years ago - seriously, go watch <strong>Rent</strong> and see for yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She doesn't look a day older than her character <strong>Maureen</strong>. She admits, though, turning 50 was harder than she thought it would be, even if she was, overall, well adjusted about her age. "I'm feeling like the old lady sometimes, and that's not who I am," she says. So what makes her feel more confident going into this next decade of her life? We collected all her anti-aging secrets here.</p><h2 id=gentle-face-cleansers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Gentle Face Cleansers</span></h2><p>Idina Menzel knows the foundation for any great skincare routine is a gentle cleanser for everyday use. She uses Cetaphil, which she says is recommended to her by her dermatologist, as well as <a href=#>Tatcha's Camellia Cleansing Oil</a>. She explains that she likes it because the oily texture isn't greasy and it takes eye makeup off really well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=retinol><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Retinol</span></h2><p>Like any woman of a certain age, Idina Menzel is packing the retinol. She uses <a href=#>SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.3</a>, which she explains feels a little like a peel in that it is great at exfoliating. Retinols, which are derivatives of vitamin A, are known for their anti-aging properties, as they boost the production of elastin and collagen, and they're touted by nearly every celebrity as the secret to staying looking great well into the middle age years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Idina Menzel Before Voicing Elsa In 'Frozen'?</a></span></p><h2 id=moisturizers><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Moisturizers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Idina Menzel also uses moisturizers by Tatcha, the same brand as her secondary cleanser. She loves that it comes in a tiny little jar with a spoon and carries it with her everywhere, especially when she is traveling a lot and is in and out of airports and planes. Her skin gets dry, she explains, so this is the perfect thing to take with her everywhere. The specific product she uses is the Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair and the Tatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Night Concentrate.</p><h2 id=eye-serum><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Eye Serum</span></h2><p>To top off her skincare routine, ageless beauty Idina Menzel swears by her eye serum, which is from Charlotte Tilbury: the Cryo-Recovery Eye Serum. "It makes my skin look five years younger," the Frozen star says.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-steaming-routine><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her Steaming Routine</span></h2><p>A veteran of the Broadway stage, Idina Menzel knows better than anyone how important it is to keep your airways steamed and hydrated. She swears by her steaming routine, which she does in her steam shower. "I find it's very healing, more than just your typical 'tea and honey' [a long-standing trick of the trade among singers]." "I let the steam get into my throat and I can even warm up my voice and vocalize. And I steam my skin, which is great for getting all that stuff off of my face. When I was playing the Green Witch in Wicked, I had so much makeup to get off -- it was an ordeal. The steam really helped, and my skin looked good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Was Josh Gad Up To Before 'Frozen'?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-plays-it-safe-with-her-health><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Plays It Safe With Her Health</span></h2><p>The Glee star explains that she doesn't take any chances when it comes to her health, especially as she ages. She stresses the importance of staying in front of any illness and nipping any ailments in the bud. "If I feel anything, I run to the doctor," she says.</p><h2 id=healthy-diet><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Healthy Diet</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For better or for worse, actors are prized for the way they look, and youth is especially desirable in show business. So Idina Menzel doesn't have the luxury of keeping a casual diet; her livelihood literally depends on her physical form. For that reason, she has to be pretty discerning when it comes to her diet. She says she eats a lot of fruit, always making sure she has fresh blueberries, raspberries, and watermelon on hand at home. If she's on set, it can be difficult to stick to healthy food options, so she always makes sure there are apples and almond butter in her trailer for her to have as snacks. She is trying to be gluten-free so she also enjoys Pure bars. She swaps out butter for Earth Balance spread and almond milk for milk. For lunch and dinner, she says, "I love sushi. I eat lots of chicken, or a piece of grilled fish like tilapia, with spinach and brussels sprouts."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Before 'Frozen', Kristen Bell Almost Voiced Another Disney Princess</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sleep-hygiene><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sleep Hygiene</span></h2><p>A self-proclaimed "big sleeper," Idina Menzel makes sure to get plenty of sleep no matter how much she has going on. She loves to take "a yummy, warm afternoon nap with my son and husband on the weekend. The three of us might play in our backyard or go to the park, if we're in Los Angeles. In New York, we go to the Museum of Natural History or sometimes we just walk. When we go out with Walker, we explore the city in a new way, through his eyes.</p><h2 id=yoga-and-boxing><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Yoga And Boxing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Idina Menzel loves Bikram yoga and boxing to keep her figure just as trim as it was when she played Maureen in Rent. "I like to box and I have a trainer. I take the art of boxing seriously, but make sure I don't get punched in the face. I do get to punch big, tough guys, and they practice their defense. It's a great workout for the core."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Britney Spears Explains Why Disney's 'Frozen' Is Her Favorite Movie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmoJ2hnpZ6rrHNs5ylZZ2Wu6KzxKxkraddobywt4ytn55lo5a6pnnArGSsoJVisaqwjGpsZrGVlr%2B0ecCgpmaqlaPBbrnArqmenZ5is7O72Z6laA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-idina-menzel-manages-to-look-the-same-as-she-did-15-years-ago-rent-maureen-frozen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maegan-hall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-561076-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maegan-hall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-561076-html.html>Maegan Hall Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nude-illusion-mesh-tops-shirts-bodysuit-best-amazon.html>Best Nude and Illusion Mesh Tops on Amazon: 21 Picks</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nude-illusion-mesh-tops-shirts-bodysuit-best-amazon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
