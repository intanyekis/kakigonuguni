A natural actress who rose to the top of Hollywood from her teenage role in The Crush. Alicia Silverstone describes herself as a natural entertainer who makes people happy with her life on and off the screen. Despite the decades of publicity that accompany the 1976 born actress, there is so much that happens in the background that people rarely notice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities who worked regular Jobs before they got famous</a></span></p><p>Silverstone's career has seen her rise to the top with lots of precious awards. She has also been at some low points, such as her appearance in 2009's controversial&nbsp;A Gathering Storm.&nbsp;With all that publicity, there is still so much we don`t know about Alicia Silverstone. Here are the ten most interesting facts about her.</p><h2 id=she-ate-her-placenta>SHE ATE HER PLACENTA</h2><p>This is a hard pill to swallow, literally, but Alicia Silverstone loved it. Silverstone is a vegan mother. She believes that a plant-based diet can help mothers prevent miscarriage and improve fertility. She also said that eating your placenta after birth gives you <a href=#>a happy start as a mother</a>.</p><p>Silverstone had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her son`s placenta</a> encapsulated into pills, which she called her happy pills. In her book, The Kind Mama, she also gives details of how she enjoyed feeding her baby hew own chewed food and cosleeping with her baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-loves-to-garden-naked>SHE LOVES TO GARDEN NAKED</h2><p>Alicia Silverstone is a renown naturalist, and her actions sometimes seem to shock everyone. In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she confessed</a> to Health Magazine that she strips when trimming her hedges then proceeds to take a swim in her birthday suit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Swiming After A Meal will not do you any harm, Research Claims</a></span></p><p>Silverstone&nbsp;also admitted that she loves jumping on the trampoline while in the nude and said she sees no reason for anyone to put on a bathing suit. Despite her weird gardening habit,&nbsp;the actress insists that she is not a nudist. She, however, stressed that she is not going to strip on stage for any movie.</p><h2 id=she-threatened-to-resign-from-her-role-on-the-graduate>SHE THREATENED TO RESIGN FROM HER ROLE ON THE GRADUATE</h2><p>Alicia Silverstone has very tough rules regarding nudity on stage. While acting the famous nude scene on The Graduate, Alicia insisted that she puts on her panties or she would resign from the production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The producers were forced to comply with her demands to prevent extra costs of production. She has maintained her policy of having no nude photos of her in the theaters on all her movies.</p><h2 id=she-was-a-cheerleader-in-highschool>SHE WAS A CHEERLEADER IN HIGHSCHOOL</h2><p>San Mateo high school in California is the center of Alicia Silverstone's&nbsp;most exciting times in life. She was already famous in High school after featuring in several films and commercials. She, however, enjoyed her time in high school like any other non-famous person.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Famous Former NFL Cheerleaders Who Are Worth a Fortune</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Silverstone was an active member of the San Mateos cheerleading squad in 1991, becoming a jewel for her school in her popular films like The Crush while&nbsp;still entertaining the crowds in the arena.</p><h2 id=she-does-not-do-nude-scenes-on-set>SHE DOES&nbsp;NOT DO&nbsp;NUDE SCENES ON SET</h2><p>One of the most iconic stands of Alicia Silverstone's&nbsp;career is her opposition to nudism on set. The Crush's producers were forced to get body doubles for all nude scenes. She maintained her stand when she was given a role on The Babysitter,&nbsp;forcing the producers to rewrite the scripts, so she didn`t have to play any nude scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress's principles have seen her lose many roles to other actresses who are more flexible.</p><h2 id=she-was-turned-down-from-a-role-for-being-too-heavy>SHE WAS TURNED DOWN FROM A ROLE FOR BEING TOO HEAVY</h2><p>Everyone would definitely disagree with this declaration because Alicia Silverstone is one of the fittest people in Hollywood today but not 1n 94, at least, as far as the cameras can see. The producers of My Father The Hero&nbsp;preferred Katherine Heigl to Silverstone for the role of Nicole sighting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">body size issues</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Iconic Movie Roles Celebrities Turned Down</a></span></p><p>Apparently, Silverstone was considered a little too heavy for the role.

By this time, Alicia was, however, already a decade old into modeling, having appeared in commercials for Domino's Pizza since 1992 at the age of six.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her father took the first photos of her that caught the attention of producers. Her first acting credit, however, came later when she appeared in an episode of The Wonder Years.</p><h2 id=she-emancipated-at-15-to-bypass-labor-laws>SHE EMANCIPATED AT 15 TO BYPASS LABOR LAWS</h2><p>The Crush&nbsp;was Alicia Silverstone`s stepping stone as it opened doors to many more roles on-screen, including a $10 million deal with Sony. However, while acting for the movie, she was only 15, and labor laws put a restriction on the number of hours she could dedicate to the cinema.</p><p>Silverstone was keen on achieving her dreams as an actor, so she decided to bypass the law by simply putting it out of her way. It was a smart move as it allowed the actress to step into the limelight as one of the greatest celebrities of all time.</p><h2 id=she-is-an-animal-rights-activist-and-a-vegan>SHE IS AN ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST AND A VEGAN</h2><p>Silverstone's stand on animal rights is one of the most radical of any celebrity in Hollywood. She has never posed naked in any movie, but she has done it many times in PETA ads. Her most notable appearance was on towards the end of 2018&nbsp;when she posed naked in Times Square urging people to leave wool behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Silverstone argues that wool is harvested by hurting sheep during shearing and that it is cruel to animals. She also <a href=#>became a vegan</a> after declaring that she realized she had been an animal lover that loved eating animals.</p><h2 id=she-is-critical-of-vaccinations>SHE&nbsp;IS CRITICAL OF VACCINATIONS</h2><p>Anti-vaccination celebrities&nbsp;are controversial in the US, especially with the recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">resurgence in measles cases</a>, which is why tabloids have not been too kind to Alicia Silverstone in recent years.</p><p>Silverstone strongly warned fellow mothers against vaccinating their children in her book <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kind Mama</a>. She argued that there was no conclusive evidence that a one-shot vaccination was scientifically safe and that many children are never the same after getting the jab.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Richest Kid Actors Ever</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nkaG2pLXAZqqipKaav7TAzqecZp6RmMG0ec2erZ6qXaC7psOO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falicia-silverstone-facts-never-knew.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falicia-silverstone-facts-never-knew.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falicia-silverstone-facts-never-knew.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falicia-silverstone-facts-never-knew.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falicia-silverstone-facts-never-knew.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falicia-silverstone-facts-never-knew.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20-memes-that-got-people-in-serious-trouble.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20-memes-that-got-people-in-serious-trouble.html>20 Memes That Got People In Serious Trouble</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./171865-momma-dee-shows-her-abs-revealing-glitte-html.html>LHHATL Star Momma Dee Shows off Flat Tummy in New Photo with Rapper 50 Cent While in Las Vegas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./171865-momma-dee-shows-her-abs-revealing-glitte-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
