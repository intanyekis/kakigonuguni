He missed two prime years of his career while serving in the Army during the 1951 and 1952 seasons.</p><p>A member of six Yankees World Series championship teams (1950, ’53, ’56, ’58, ’61-62) and 11 pennant winners, he still holds many World Series records, including those for wins (10), consecutive scoreless innings (33.0) and strikeouts (94).</p><p>In 1961, he had his signature season, anchoring the Yankees’ pitching staff on one of the most dominant teams of all-time and earning the AL Cy Young Award with a 25-4 (.862) record, 3.21 ERA and 11 complete games in 283.0 innings pitched. He also won the World Series MVP Award that year with a 2-0 record and 14.0 scoreless innings pitched in the Yankees’ 4-games-to-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds as the starting pitcher in Games 1 and 4.</p><p>In 1974, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame alongside teammate Mickey Mantle, and his No.16 was retired at Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.</p><p>In franchise history, Ford ranks first in wins (236), innings pitched (3,170.1) and shutouts (45), tied for first in games started (438), second in strikeouts (1,958), third in winning percentage (.690, min: 100 decisions), fourth in games pitched (498), fifth in ERA (2.75) and tied for sixth in complete games (156).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-age></span> Whitey Ford Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford was born on October 21, 1928, in New York City, New York.

He was a treasure, and one of the greatest of Yankees to ever wear the pinstripes. Beyond the accolades that earned him his rightful spot within the walls of the Hall of Fame, in so many ways he encapsulated the spirit of the Yankees teams he played for and represented for nearly two decades.</p><p>“Whitey was New York tough. When you couple that with his dedicated service to our country, a deep love for the only team he ever played for, six World Championships, and a genuine personality and charisma that showed throughout his life, it’s no wonder he endeared himself as a legend to generations of Yankees fans everywhere.</p><p>“While there is comfort knowing Whitey was surrounded by his family at the time of his passing while watching his favorite team compete, this is a tremendous loss to the Yankees and the baseball community. We have lost our ‘Chairman of the Board,’ and we extend our deepest condolences to the entire Ford family.”</p><p>Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement: “Today all of Major League Baseball mourns the loss of Whitey Ford, a New York City native who became a legend for his hometown team. Whitey earned his status as the ace of some of the most memorable teams in our sport’s rich history. Beyond the Chairman of the Board’s excellence on the mound, he was a distinguished ambassador for our National Pastime throughout his life. I extend my deepest condolences to Whitey’s family, his friends and admirers throughout our game, and all fans of the Yankees.”</p><p>In addition to Whitey Ford, other baseball greats who have passed away in 2020 include Al Kaline, Tom Seaver, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-cause-of-death></span> Whitey Ford Cause of Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford’s cause of death was not revealed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-net-worth></span> Whitey Ford Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford’s net worth was estimated to be $4 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYnsGmxYyfpqucXay2rLWMmp6eZaees6Z5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6FlnprBbsPOq6uhZZaWuqq42GaaoaGcmb%2BmuoywoJ%2BdXZ%2B8orqMn6arnF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1000-lb-sisters-tammy-shows-some-skin-in-pic-with-spiritual-sister.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1000-lb-sisters-tammy-shows-some-skin-in-pic-with-spiritual-sister.html>1000-Lb.
