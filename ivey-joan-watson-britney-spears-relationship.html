While Britney has two sons, Jamie Lynn happens to have two girls, the youngest of which is Ivey Watson Spears (<a href=#>who also happens to be a budding photographer</a>). As fans may expect, Britney has also become a doting aunt to the little girl.</p><h2 id=britney-has-always-been-a-constant-presence-in-ivey-s-life>Britney Has Always Been A Constant Presence In Ivey’s Life</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Lynn gave birth to Ivey back in April 2018 and Britney joined the family in celebrating the little girl’s arrival. “I could not be more excited to welcome baby Ivey to this world,” the singer tweeted. “Congrats to @jamieLynnnspears and the whole family - I love you all so much!!!” Later on, Britney was also pictured in a family photo with baby Ivey. They were also joined by Britney’s sons, Sean Preston and Jayden James, along with Jamie Lynn’s older daughter, Maddie. Jamie Lynn posted the photo on Instagram and simply captioned it “Family.”</p><p>Jamie also took Ivey to see her Auntie Britney in concert just months after she was born. Little Ivey rocked out in style with a pair of pink noise-canceling earmuffs. Britney’s younger sister even posted a short video capturing Ivey’s experience with the caption, “Ivey’s first time seeing her Auntie Britney.” At the same time, Jamie Lynn also took to Instagram stories with a photo her and Ivey while at the concert. She also wrote, “Looked up to her since the day I was born. Couple more people look up to her now also. But I was the first.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Jamie Lynn threw a rainbow-themed party for Ivey’s first birthday. It seemed, however, that Britney was unable to make it as the celebration took place right after the singer checked into a health facility. That said, Jamie Lynn and her family made the trip from Louisiana to California to hang out with Britney at the singer’s home later that year. In fact, Ivey and her sister Maddie were even photographed playing in their aunt’s pool. The older kids were also pictured playing in the trampoline while Ivey looked on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears Fans Say They're 'Suspicious' Of BF As He Talks Acting Ambitions</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later that year, Jamie Lynn and her daughters reunited with Britney once more. But this time, it looks like it was Britney who made the trip to see her sister. Jamie Lynn took some photos of their reunion, which even featured Britney doing acrobatic stunts with both Ivey and Maddie.</p><p>Today, Ivey is just little bit older and starting to develop her very own fashion style. As expected, her Aunt Britney is very supportive of the young girl’s love of pink and unicorns. In fact, Britney sent some purses that Ivey can use the next time she goes out. Meanwhile, Jamie Lynn posted a photo of Ivey with Britney’s gifts and wrote, “Auntie always sending the cutest purses for my girl. @britneyspears she loves em [sic] all.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-even-quarantined-to-see-ivey-last-year>She Even Quarantined To See Ivey Last Year</h2><p>Meanwhile, not even the pandemic could keep Britney apart from family, especially her nieces. Last year, the singer made the decision to make her way home to be with her loved ones. “Britney was like, 'I want to come home, I don't want to be by myself out here,' because all of her family's pretty much here. So she was able to come home for almost two weeks or so,” Jamie Lynn explained during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Fox News</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears' Resurfaced Video Shows How Badly She Wanted To Be In 'The Notebook'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, however, it looks like Britney decided to quarantine in time to celebrate Jamie and Ivey’s birthdays. Jamie Lynn confirmed, “She was here for my birthday and for [my daughter] Ivey's birthday.” In the end, it also looked like Britney got to stay longer than planned because of the stay-at-home orders. “I think she went back with the intentions of like, this was only going to be another week or so, and then they added on more time [to the stay-at-home orders]. We're all just trying to abide by the rules and do what we're supposed to do.”</p><p>In the end, Britney got to spend more time with her loved ones, including little Ivey. “Having our family has been the biggest blessing, too,” Jamie remarked. “I mean, we're driving each other absolutely insane, about things you wouldn't normally get mad about, but at the end of the day, at least we have each other, you know? That's been really fortunate.”</p><p>Britney may have a lot going on in her life, but the singer certainly puts her family first. And with&nbsp;Britney around, Ivey can look forward to spending more time with her famous aunt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Britney Spears Responds To Selena Gomez's Hilarious Throwback Video</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigr52pYrewrc1mrpqso6S7bq7RoqunnaliwLGxwKuqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fivey-joan-watson-britney-spears-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fivey-joan-watson-britney-spears-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fivey-joan-watson-britney-spears-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fivey-joan-watson-britney-spears-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fivey-joan-watson-britney-spears-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fivey-joan-watson-britney-spears-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jazmin-bean.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jazmin-bean.html>Jazmin Bean | Lyrics, Song Meanings &amp;amp; Music Videos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./greg-deaton-death-senior-pastor-of-new-salem-baptist-church-in-london-ky-passes-away.html>Greg Deaton Death, Senior Pastor of New Salem Baptist Church in London, KY, Passes Away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./greg-deaton-death-senior-pastor-of-new-salem-baptist-church-in-london-ky-passes-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
