She earned international fame by starring in the American reality TV series&nbsp;<i>Shahs of Sunset.</i></p><p>Moreover, Golnesa is a mother as well as a successful businesswoman who owns and handles multiple businesses. She is the&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;Wüsah, a medicinal cannabis company.</p><h2>Relationship: Is Golnesa Gharachedaghi Single?</h2><p>Throughout the period of time in<i> Bravo</i>'s <i>Shahs of Sunset</i>, we have seen GG going through her personal moments like dating and marriage.</p><p>She was engaged to <strong>Shalom Yeroushalmi</strong> in <strong>December 2016</strong> after meeting him in the apartment complex and dating for a short time. The ex-couple finally decided to tie their knot in <strong>January 2017</strong> by organizing a surprise wedding for their fans and family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/8/23/gg%20with%20shalom_resized-min%20(1)-1661235830587.jpg><p>However, just after seven weeks of their marriage, in <strong>March 2017,</strong> GG and Shalom got separated and decided to end their marriage. Golnesa filed for divorce in <strong>May 2017</strong>, declaring irreconcilable differences. Nearly two years after she filed the divorce, they officially divorced in <strong>January 2019</strong>.</p><p>At this date, the <i>Shahs of Sunset</i>&nbsp;star Golnesa&nbsp;is single and happy to live her life this way. She claims that being independent and single is far happier than being in a relationship.</p><h2>Reason For Golnesa&nbsp;Quick Divorce</h2><p>"Shalom Yeroushalmi was more traditional than I am," GG claimed. She said that she never believed in marriage. The only reason she married Shalom was to make him happy, she also quoted:</p><p>"I knew what I did was wrong and it wasn't for me or for my happiness, but for someone else, and I guess for one moment I thought maybe someone else's happiness will do it for me. And it didn't."</p><p>The fan favorite of&nbsp;<i>Shahs of Sunset&nbsp;</i>also added that marrying Shalom was her biggest mistake, and she will try hard not to regret that decision. On&nbsp;<i>Watch What Happens Live</i>, she claimed that all Shalom wanted was her money, and he decided to go for it legally.&nbsp;</p><h2>Children: Does GG Have Any Children?</h2><p>Despite being single, GG has a son <strong>Elijah Javad Gharachedaghi</strong>.
