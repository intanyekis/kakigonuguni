On his 4th birthday, they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/ySSilSi3l8/?hl=en">observed</a> a snowy birthday at the Sundance Film Festival.</p><p class=dh>Months after his birthday in 2015, Connie and Eyob had fun at the beach as they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/4uu5jwi3hV/?hl=en">celebrated</a> Independence day on July 4. In January 2016, they both <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BA6B4l6i3sw/?hl=en">weathered</a> the storm together in Nashville, and Eyob was out in the snow later.</p><p class=dh>In December 2017, Connie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BdJHP1GFkO4/?hl=en">showed</a> her fans that Eyob was the clown as he put on the red clown nose and posed for a picture during Christmas.</p><p class=dh>For her birthday in 2020, the actress shared that she celebrated the day with Eyob. From the images she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9fovlQDCy3/?hl=en">shared</a> on her Instagram page, they blew out the candles on her cake together.</p><p class=dh>Connie once revealed that ever since the adoption, Eyob had always inspired her as he had a love of life and an open and curious heart. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/connie-britton-son-open-curious-heart/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"He's very into learning and seeing what's happening and seeing what people are doing.

However, after losing both her parents in a short time, and she wasn't in a relationship leading to marriage, Connie asked herself what she was waiting for.</p><p class=dh>"The White Lotus" actress knew she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvTPJbkXMLw">wanted</a> to adopt and could do it, so it happened for her. However, she also admitted that the process is much more complex than anyone could think at the beginning.</p><p class=dh>Once she started the process, it took three years for her to achieve her dreams of motherhood. Connie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/connie-britton-adopts-son-yoby/>welcomed</a> her 9-month-old Ethiopian son Eyob whose nickname is Yoby, after she returned from the country.</p><p class=dh>As Eyob grew older, Connie intentionally taught him about his roots. Besides being vocal about it, Eyob has a map of Ethiopia and Africa in his room, and they also travel back to Africa almost every other year.</p><p class=dh>Connie further revealed that Eyob is proud of being from Ethiopia as it always made him feel special. Although she feels lucky with Eyob, Connie is unsure about adopting another.</p><p class=dh>The actress who said yes and no about being ready to give Yoby a little brother or sister <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/connie-britton-teaches-son-eyob-about-his-ethiopian-culture/>said</a> once you become a parent, you realize that it isn't super easy but challenging!</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DOES EYOB HAVE A FATHER?</strong></p><p class=dh>Connie was married to John Britton for four years from 1991 to 1995, and she has mastered the art of keeping her love life under the radar ever since.</p><p class=dh>The Friday Night Lights alum never remarried after her divorce and chose to keep her married name. However, in 2009, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/nashville-casts-dating-history-connie-britton-more/>said</a> she had a great man in her life who was a comedy writer but never revealed his name.</p><p class=dh>Years later, there is no information on whether they are still together or if there is another man in her life now who can be a father figure for Eyob.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>BEING MOTHER TO EYOB WASN'T EASY AT THE BEGINNING</strong></p><p class=dh>Despite loving being a mother to Eyob, Connie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/connie-britton-on-raising-son-yoby-becoming-new-mom-no-support/>revealed</a> that becoming a single mother at a point when she had to move to Nashville was difficult as she had no support system there.</p><p class=dh>She felt everything changed, especially her outlook on life and how she knew herself.
