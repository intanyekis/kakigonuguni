Taiwan has gotten offensive contributions up and down its lineup, and its pitching has completely shut down opposing batters so far.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Taiwan’s Fan Chen-Jun is drawing comparisons to Shohei Ohtani. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“Preparing for Japan, we know they are basically the empire for many series. We always prepared to have a very hard competition today,” manager Lee Cheng-Ta said following Monday’s win. “In fact, I prepared three or five pitchers. It just happened that we got lucky that their pitcher got nervous, so we were able to finish early today.”</p><p>Taiwan also boasts Fan Chen-Jun, a 12-year-old throwing 80 mph fastballs with a devastating slider. The reaction time required from a Little League hitter on an 80 mph pitch is about the same needed from an MLB hitter to handle a pitch well over 100 mph.</p><p>Oh, and he has yet to allow a hit in 6 2/3 innings with 15 strikeouts. <a href=#>He was perfect against Canada</a> and allowed a walk and a hit by pitch to Japan.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Fan Chen-Jun celebrates a homer during the Little League World Series. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>And one more thing — he hit a home run against Canada and was intentionally walked against Japan.</p><p>Fan has been the unquestioned star of the tournament thus far and drew quick comparisons to MLB’s two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani.</p><p>He’s been casual about his performances, saying he didn’t even realize he threw three more no-hit innings against Japan until seeing the final box score.</p><p>Lee said he found Fan two years ago and saw more athletic ability than he “had ever seen,” thinking he had potential as a baseball player.</p><p>That was a safe bet.</p><p>“He has the speed, he has the coordination, he has the jumping ability,” Lee said. “I wish him to be safe and not to get injured. He has a lot of future to come in his baseball career.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Shohei Ohtani is a two-way phenom for the Angels. <span class=credit>USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Con</span></figure><p>Fan threw 51 pitches Monday, meaning he’s not available to pitch again in Wednesday’s matchup against Curacao under pitch limits. That’s OK, says Lee, because he prepared even more pitchers to throw against Japan expecting the game would be much closer.</p><p>Lee named Liu You-An and Hsu Shao-Chieh as the two he would have thrown against Japan, as well as three more unnamed who were “in the pipeline.” Neither one has pitched yet in the tournament.</p><p>However, the three pitchers not named Fan used by Taiwan thus far have also combined for 3 1/3 innings of perfect baseball. Chiu Tse-Wei and Cai Yuan-Ho finished the combined perfect game against Canada, the first one in the Little League World Series since 2017.</p><p>The game against Curacao is a rematch of 2022’s tournament semifinal, which Curacao won 1-0. The Taiwanese team is different, but Curacao has the same club back in South Williamsport and five returning players from the team that lost in last year’s championship.</p><p>Curacao has won a pair of close games, 2-1 wins over Australia and Venezuela, to get here.</p><p>The winner moves on to the tournament semifinal while the loser heads to a win-or-go-home game in the elimination bracket.</p><p>“We have great respect for the Curacao team, not just as a baseball team, the whole country has great baseball players who even play professional baseball here,” Lee said. “I just want the players to focus one day at a time and to be as they are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma2tfqa6qw8CnZKWhpKm5pnnLnpigrZVixLC%2By51krJ2inrK0edOemKZlnJqxbq7YZqqtmaJis6K6jJyfnqZdn8Kvew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaiwan-little-league-world-series-team-led-by-star-fan-chen-jun.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./andrea-bocelli-son-matteo-relationship-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./andrea-bocelli-son-matteo-relationship-facts.html>The Truth About Andrea Bocelli's Relationship With His Son Matteo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./abbie-cornish-wiki-bio-net-worth-facts-dating-married.html>Personal life, Net worth, and Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./abbie-cornish-wiki-bio-net-worth-facts-dating-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
