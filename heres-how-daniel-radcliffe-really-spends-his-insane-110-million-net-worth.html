The role catapulted Daniel to Hollywood A-list status, not only earning him millions, but many parts to come, some of which he isn't all the happy with.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Alan Rickman's Off-Screen Relationship With The Harry Potter Cast Was Nothing Like What Happens In The Movies</a></span></p><p>Despite being embarrassed about some of his past choices, he doesn't necessarily regret his time in the franchise because it's opened many doors for him and given him a vault of money. So, <a href=# rel=nofollow>what exactly does Daniel Radcliffe spend his money on</a>? Let's find out!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on March 24, 2023: </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Daniel Radcliffe has stuck to mostly Indie</a> and "oddball" roles since his time in the Harry Potter franchise, and he seems to be loving it. In 2022, the actor appeared in five productions, including the film The Lost City, Weird: The Weird Al Yankovic Story, and his starring role in the television series Miracle Workers.</p><p>As of now, it appears that Miracle Workers is the only title that Radcliffe is working on. Daniel is likely taking a short break to enjoy some time off, perhaps to visit with friends and family before returning to Hollywood.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-daniel-radcliffe-make-from-harry-potter>How Much Did Daniel Radcliffe Make From Harry Potter?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8764CC39-AB6F-42CF-BD75-AB21225A00A9.jpeg><p>Like Harry Potter himself, Radcliffe had his millions stored somewhere safe by his parents until the day he really needed it. But his money wasn't protected by dragons in an underground vault in Gringotts, of course!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After seeing how successful Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was, Radcliffe’s parents thought ahead and created Gilmore Jacobs Ltd. in 2001, just to manage their son's finances. When he turned 18 in 2007, the company was worth $40 million. Today, CompanyCheck.co.uk estimates its worth at around $86.1 million, and after all eight films, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBS says Radcliffe made $95.6 million</a>. Talk about an impressive paycheck, right?</p><p>"If somebody asked me, 'Did you think you deserve that money?' No, of course, I didn’t. 'But would you have taken it anyway?' Of course. I happened to have found this industry where people get paid stupid amounts of money," Radcliffe told The Telegraph in 2012. "That’s the reality. I feel almost guilty for having done so well out of Potter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-is-all-about-giving-back>Daniel Radcliffe Is All About Giving Back</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-9.jpg><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe combats that guilt by donating to charity</a> whenever he can. Radcliffe told The Guardian in 2013 that he didn't even know how much money he had until he was 19. At the time, he said the "most valuable thing" he does with his money is to give back.</p><p>"It doesn’t matter what you do, no matter what line of work you’re in, you can never really deserve that amount of money," he said. "It just so happens I’m in an industry where those sums of money are dealt with. And I’m very lucky to be in a position where I don’t have to do a job just for the money."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>This Is Daniel Radcliffe's Highest-Paid Project Since He Earned $50 Million For Deathly Hallows</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daniel not only spends his money on charity but his time, too! Radcliffe is the vice president of children's hospice Demelza, an organization that aids end-of-life youth, which Daniel has made clear is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a cause very "close to his heart."</a> Daniel has also worked closely with The Trevor Project and was awarded the Hero Award for his work with the charity in suicide prevention among the LGBTQ+ community.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-doesn-39-t-know-how-to-spend-his-money>Daniel Radcliffe Doesn't Know How To Spend His Money</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar50296826.jpg><p>Since coming into his wealth, Radcliffe admits that he's actually not a big spender. In fact, he's "terrible" at spending his millions; his friends even laugh at him for it. "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I don’t do a huge amount with my money</a>," Radcliffe told James O’Brien’s podcast Full Disclosure. "I’m not particularly extravagant. There are moments where I think, 'Man, I’m really bad at being famous.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He told The Belfast Telegraph that he decided to keep all his money stocked away so that he could explore different verticals in his career. "I’m very grateful for it because having money means you don’t have to worry about it, which is a very lovely freedom to have," he said in 2016.</p><p>But Radcliffe joked that there are probably people out there who could've done "way more cool, crazy, wild stuff with their money." Saving his money in Gilmore Jacobs Ltd. and later stocking it away for career advancements isn't the only wise financial decision Radcliffe's made. When he does decide to spend his millions, it seems as if he wants to make sure he gets money back in return.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daniel Radcliffe Once Worried About J.K.

After he made his Broadway debut in 2008 for Equus, he bought a New York City apartment for $4.8 million. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">According to The Richest</a>, he started putting it up for rent for $30,000 a month.</p><p>By 2009, he had three apartments worth a combined $16.5 million, including one that cost him $4.29 million, which is also available for rent through Halstead Property for $19,000 a month. It has two bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a gym and a swimming pool.</p><p>Among Radcliffe's weirder purchases over the years is a $17,000 mattress (he has to get a good night's sleep, doesn't he?) and a $2 million Kaleidoscope Painting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-the-fame-and-fortune-gotten-to-daniel-radcliffe>Has The Fame And Fortune Gotten To Daniel Radcliffe?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/daniel-radcliffe-in-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-via-salon-com.jpg><p>When it comes to being one of the biggest names in Hollywood, all while being attached to one of the biggest film franchises, it's no surprise that Daniel wasn't able to cope with his fame and fortune all too well. The actor admitted to resorting to drinking after becoming "attracted to chaos," he said.</p><p>Radcliffe officially quit drinking during the filming of the final Harry Potter film in 2011, however he relapsed shortly after. Luckily for him, his millions came in handy as a means to get him sober. Daniel has remained sober since and has been very vocal about his sobriety and past alcoholism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although being worth $110 million might seem like a dream, it's evident that it all became too much for Radcliffe, which is why he chooses to live a somewhat "normal" life, considering what his growing fame led to in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmm5qmmZq5br7AnZqloZabsm6%2BxJqjpbFdqL2musOsZKGho2K2r7%2FAp5xmaWFleq61y6WgqKZdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-daniel-radcliffe-really-spends-his-insane-110-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-how-daniel-radcliffe-really-spends-his-insane-110-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-daniel-radcliffe-really-spends-his-insane-110-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-how-daniel-radcliffe-really-spends-his-insane-110-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-daniel-radcliffe-really-spends-his-insane-110-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-daniel-radcliffe-really-spends-his-insane-110-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jason-geier-obituary-fort-recovery-ohio-jason-geier-has-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jason-geier-obituary-fort-recovery-ohio-jason-geier-has-died.html>Jason Geier Obituary, Fort Recovery Ohio, Jason Geier Has Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ava-mcclure.html>Ava McClure</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ava-mcclure.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
